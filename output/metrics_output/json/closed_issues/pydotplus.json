In particular [`nlhelper/pydot`](https://github.com/nlhepler/pydot) appears to be a predecessor of this one. If so, then is there any coordination between this fork and that one? For example, keeping this one and removing the other one.\n\nAnother issue concerns the package name. Is there any correspondence with the original author of `pydot`? Since there are developers interested in maintaining `pydot`, it would be good if there was a single fork for the community to contribute to. Even better, if that fork was called `pydot` and was available as such on PyPI.\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}]}
