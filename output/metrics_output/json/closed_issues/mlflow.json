I manually checked the files MLmodel, conda.yml, model.pkl are inside the copied local dir `/tmp/tmp42yolmhz/model`.\r\n\r\nIn `mlflow.utils.model_utils` the function `_get_flavor_configuration` throws an exception, because it expects that model_path contains the files MLmodel, conda.yml, model.pkl, but model_path is `/tmp/tmp42yolmhz/ with contains only `model/` which then contains MLmodel, conda.yml, model.pkl.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nHopefully this is a reproducible test case with the bare minimum necessary to replicate the problem.\r\n\r\nModified example from [issue 3197](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3197#issuecomment-666116249).\r\n\r\nFTP-Server:\r\n```shell script\r\nsudo docker run -d --name ftpd_server -p 2222:21 -p 30000-30009:30000-30009 -e \"PUBLICHOST=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX\"     -e FTP_USER_NAME=mlflow -e FTP_USER_PASS=mlflow -e FTP_USER_HOME=/home/mlflow stilliard/pure-ftpd\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nimport string\r\nimport random\r\n\r\nimport mlflow\r\nimport mlflow.sklearn\r\nfrom mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test():\r\n    mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:5000/')\r\n\r\n    def get_random_string(length):\r\n        letters = string.ascii_lowercase\r\n        return ''.join(random.choice(letters) for i in range(length))\r\n\r\n    expr_name = get_random_string(32)\r\n    artifact_location = \"ftp://mlflow:mlflow@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:2222/mlruns\"\r\n\r\n    if mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(expr_name) is None:\r\n        mlflow.create_experiment(expr_name, artifact_location)\r\n\r\n    mlflow.set_experiment(expr_name)\r\n\r\n    training_input = pd.DataFrame({'1': [1, 2, 3], '2': [4, 5, 6]})\r\n    predict_input = pd.DataFrame({'1': [10, 20, 30], '2': [40, 50, 60]})\r\n\r\n    with mlflow.start_run():\r\n        print('mlflow version:', mlflow.__version__)\r\n        print('tracking URI:', mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\n        print('artifact URI:', mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n\r\n        scaler = StandardScaler()\r\n        output = scaler.fit_transform(training_input)\r\n\r\n        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(scaler, artifact_path='model',\r\n                                 registered_model_name='model-reg')\r\n        client = MlflowClient()\r\n        version = client.get_registered_model('model-reg').latest_versions[0].version\r\n        client.transition_model_version_stage('model-reg', version, 'Staging')\r\n\r\n        model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model('models:/' + 'model-reg' + '/Staging')\r\n\r\n        print(model)\r\n        print(model.predict(predict_input))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

should in general be available on Databricks 7.x and what the correct paths (e.g. /dbfs/databricks/...) are.\r\nAny clarification on that would be muchappreciated, thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n-\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3170", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3170/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3170/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3170/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3170", "id": 665865962, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NjU4NjU5NjI=", "number": 3170, "title": "[BUG] PDF worker file can't be found when running MLflow UI server", "user": {"login": "ankitmathur-db", "id": 52183359, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankitmathur-db", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2022849295, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDIyODQ5Mjk1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/area/tracking", "name": "area/tracking", "color": "48eabc", "default": false, "description": "Tracking service, tracking client APIs, autologging"}, {"id": 1470945519, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcwOTQ1NTE5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/area/uiux", "name": "area/uiux", "color": "ede978", "default": false, "description": "UIUX Front-end, user experience, javascript, plotting"}, {"id": 955449428, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTU0NDk0Mjg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "ankitmathur-db", "id": 52183359, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankitmathur-db", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "ankitmathur-db", "id": 52183359, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTgzMzU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/52183359?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankitmathur-db", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankitmathur-db/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-07-26T21:46:43Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-28T17:14:24Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-28T17:14:24Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue.

We don't want to add description to models or model versions after storing in database. We want while registering from API itself.\r\n\r\n- Currently we are able to update/add description after registering models to model registry. \r\n- Currently we are able to do as below, but it would be help full if we can add description while registering itself. Please see below:\r\n```\r\nclient = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()\r\nclient.update_registered_model(name=\"ElasticnetWineModel\", description=\"Describing description for model\")\r\nclient.update_model_version(name=\"ElasticnetWineModel\", version=2, description=\"Describing description for model version\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- The reason we want describing the description while registering the model itself is, we are blocking users from updating data in database. We provided them only insert permission.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

It would allow them to test their conda environment and MLproject locally with the plugin before using compute resources for remote execution.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nData scientists can quickly test if their project works locally with their specified conda environment (either local or from mlproject) with their backend plugin before remote execution. \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nAdding use_conda would make it possible for a smooth, end-to-end experience for data scientists using a backend plugin for their training and execution. This would also save time and allow all artifacts and metrics from an experiment to be stored in the plugin's tracking store instead of in two locations. \r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMy project involves creating an AzureML integration with MLflow Projects. Adding this feature would support a full workflow experience for data scientists using AzureML for their backend service.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nCurrently use_conda is not passed to backend plugins, so there is no reliable way to infer in the plugin if a user wants to run their project with their local conda environment or the environment specified in MLproject. \r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [x] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [x] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThese are the main details for the feature!\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3157", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3157/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3157/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3157/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3157", "id": 663973307, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NjM5NzMzMDc=", "number": 3157, "title": "[FR] Pagination support for list_run_infos", "user": {"login": "trangevi", "id": 26490000, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDkwMDAw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/26490000?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi", "html_url": "https://github.com/trangevi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trangevi/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2022849295, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDIyODQ5Mjk1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/area/tracking", "name": "area/tracking", "color": "48eabc", "default": false, "description": "Tracking service, tracking client APIs, autologging"}, {"id": 955449434, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTU0NDk0MzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}, {"id": 2059147368, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU5MTQ3MzY4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/needs%20committer%20feedback", "name": "needs committer feedback", "color": "b60205", "default": false, "description": "The issue needs feedback from a committer"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-07-22T18:47:50Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-06T20:32:59Z", "closed_at": "2020-08-06T20:32:59Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\n`tracking.MlflowClient.list_run_infos` provides a convenience wrapper around `search_runs`, but doesn't surface the pagination support which `search_runs` provides. This FR is to surface the necessary parameters/return handling.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? This will be beneficial for users who have a significant number of runs.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? It will allow for the continued use of the `list_run_infos` convenience function even as users scale up in the number of runs they have.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? As above, the continued use of the convenience function will be valuable to users at scale.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient). Users are currently forced to change how they interact with MLflow as their use case scales, which while not impossible is detrimental to user experience.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature. If you have a proposal for how to implement this feature, please include it here.

I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAdd spacy and fastai as part of the documentation on relevamt pages\r\n\r\n- Add to the list of [built-in model flavors ](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#built-in-model-flavors)\r\n\r\n- Add to the list of [model-apis \r\n](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-api)\r\n\r\n- Add to the fastai to Auto Logging [tracking page](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#automatic-logging)\r\n\r\n- Add to the list of [Python Model APIs\r\n](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.models.html)\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nIt is beneficial to the developer to find all built-in models well documented and searchable \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nDeveloper who wants to use spacy or fastai can find out what Python fluent APIs to use for tracking\r\n\r\nMissing documentation betrays the scope of built-in model flavors. You don't want a developer to accidentally\r\nfind out that MLflow supports fastai and spacy model flavors.

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nAbility to view deleted experiments in the MLflow UI. Similar to how runs are viewed, the ability to view deleted experiments, rename them, and restore them in the UI (potentially by adding an option to change the view) might be a useful feature.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nFor current MLflow UI users, experiments can be deleted but once deleted, they can not be seen/restore/renamed. Adding this feature would allow these actions to be done from within the MLflow UI.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis will allow all MLflow users to maintain/organize experiments from within the UI, and recover old/archived experiments. It will also make the overall experiment lifecycle more visible.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMy project involves Azure ML integration with Mlflow, including the UI - in Azure, only deleted/archived experiments can be renamed, and they can also be viewed/restored, so this feature would allow for greater parity between the two.\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nI believe MLflow is just missing UI components to view deleted experiments by changing a view type, and restore and rename said deleted experiments\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe actual version of mlflow is heavily dependent on conda package, on the other hand the use of the default pip package is widely used by the community. Therefore, the native support to pip will encourage a lot of users that do not use the conda package to start using mlflow.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? Use of mlflow without needing to use conda environments.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? It will allow to non-conda users to use features from mlflow without workarounds (like serve models).\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? It will become a standard to use mlflow since we do not use conda.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? The user needs to install manually all the packages from a requirements.txt file, this process can be automated with the proposed feature.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [X] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature request can be done by adding a new flag on MLproject files indicating the filename which contains all packages and their versions (pip freeze output). Then the mlflow can install those packages in the current environment, or create a local environment.\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url":

feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [X] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nAllow for atomic stage transitions for multiple versions (ideally in the GUI along with programmatically). For example, transition v2 from Staging to Production and v1 from Production to Archived as a single transaction. The issue this is working around is a requirement that only a single model be deployed to an environment at a time. If more than 1 is in any stage, additional logic is required to ascertain which one is to be used.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? A model deployment environment which requires a single model to be the model that is used for that environment. If a query to determine which model is in a stage happens to occur while the user is transitioning models (i.e. 0 or 2 in a stage), then it's ambiguous as to which model (if any) should be utilized)\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general? If MLflow is to become the \"truth\" for ML models, it needs to support the use of registered models by production systems. This FR allows a simplification of the logic to determine which model should be used in various deployment environments.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? We currently have added logic to address the more than 1 model case (chose the latest version number) and require the person executing the deployment in MLflow to promote the new model first before promoting (or Archiving) the existing model. This works fine, but an atomic solution would be cleaner.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? I wouldn't call it difficult, but it's less than optimal. See above.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [X] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [X] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3009", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3009/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3009/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3009/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/3009", "id": 645945421, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NDU5NDU0MjE=", "number": 3009, "title": "[SETUP-BUG] azure requirement required by default", "user": {"login": "xinluh", "id": 9114601, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTQ2MDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9114601?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh", "html_url": "https://github.com/xinluh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xinluh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 955449428, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTU0NDk0Mjg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-06-26T01:30:04Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-25T18:13:10Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-01T18:27:05Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Thank you for submitting an issue.

Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to open the registered-models page on the UI, I got an error.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 56 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17039389/85226491-b5c1a800-b412-11ea-85d6-c355100a28a5.png\">\r\n\r\nThe error is caused by a failed API request to get registered models (`/2.0/preview/mlflow/registered-models/list`) and the response says:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"error_code\": \"INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE\",\r\n  \"message\": \"Invalid value for request parameter max_results.It must be at most 1000, but got value 50000\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like `list_registered_models` calls `search_registered_models` with `max_results = 50000` which exceeds `SEARCH_REGISTERED_MODEL_MAX_RESULTS_DEFAULT (= 1000)`.  I'm not sure if this is the right approach but specifying  `max_results` in `model-registry/actions.js` solves the error.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n# model-registry/actions.js\r\nexport const listRegisteredModelsApi = (id = getUUID()) => ({\r\n  type: LIST_REGISTRED_MODELS,\r\n  payload: wrapDeferred(Services.listRegisteredModels, { max_results: 1000 }),\r\n  meta: { id },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [x] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\nI'm running on MLFlow installed from PyPi, but more relevant env info can be found below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLinux Pop!_OS 20.04\r\nPython 3.6.10 :: Anaconda, Inc.\r\n\r\nmlflow==1.8.0\r\npytorch-lightning==0.7.6\r\ntorch==1.5.0\r\ntorchvision==0.2.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nThis problem arises when pickling `MlFlowClient` objects and results in a pickling error due to the use of a higher order function within `mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/utils.py` in the `_get_rest_store(store_uri, **_)` function. There are other implementations of pickle that can handle lambda/higher order functions (e.g. Dill, CloudPickle), but  Python's built-in pickle library can not handle these methods. \r\n\r\nThis becomes _extremely_ problematic when using MLFlow in conjunction with 3rd party packages. One such example is Pytorch-Lightning, where they have implemented a [wrapper](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/630) for the MlFlowClient that ends up getting pickled during distributed applications (specifically using the DistributedDataParallel or `DDP` torch backend).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nA minimal example for reproducing this issue that mirrors how Pytorch-Lightning configured their wrapper can be found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/Polyphenolx/1b3970fe10ba70748204cd45b0f75139). Of course, wrapping the `MlFlowClient` is completely unnecessary for the reproduction of this bug- simply pickle and `MlFlowClient` object.\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\n```\r\n>> python mlflow_pickle_error.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mlflow_test.py\", line 14, in <module>\r\n    pickle.dump(cls, open('test_dump.pkl', 'wb'))\r\nAttributeError: Can't pickle local object '_get_rest_store.<locals>.get_default_host_creds'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThe pickle issue can be resolved by modifying `_get_rest_store` and removing/renaming the higher-order function, and using a partial to wrap the function call (Note: This requires adding `from functools import partial`).

I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nAllow higher configurability of the SQLAlchemy engine. [SQLAlchemy Engines](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html) provide various configuration options which can be passed in during engine creation to `sqlalchemy.create_engine`. Have a system for SQLAlchemy Engine parameters to be configured at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nSQLAlchemy configuration options can be used by users to optimize database access based on the database being used. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nThis can allow users to configure SQLAlchemy to their requirements without modifying the [engine creation code](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/db/utils.py#L175). The user can configure custom `connect_args`, Pooling options (beyond `pool_size` and `pool_overflow`), etc as defined in the [SQLAlchemy Documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html).\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nMy specific use case is to use MLFlow Server with AWS Serverless DB, in which short-lived connections are preferred over persistent connections, as produced by the default SQLAlchemy Pooling strategy. Pooling can be disabled by passing the `sqlalchemy.pool.NullPool` during engine creation, but this is not possible because of the [hardcoded configuration](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/db/utils.py#L175) (barring the options for `pool_size` and `pool_overflow`).\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nThe [configuration](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/store/db/utils.py#L175) is hardcoded currently, except for configuring the `pool_size` and `pool_overflow` parameters. While this is helpful, it is limiting. Parameters like `poolclass`, `connect_args`, `pool_timeout` cannot be configured easily without changing the codebase.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [x] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [x] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nInstead of having hardcoded environment variables for two parameters, all environment variables of the format `MLFLOW_SQLALCHEMYSTORE_*` could be read and passed in as kwargs to `sqlalchemy.create_engine`.\r\n\r\nAn issue here could be when classes have to be passed to the engine, like `poolclass=sqlalchemy.pool.NullPool`. An alternative solution could be to employ the `sqlalchemy.engine_from_config` method for engine creation.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2898", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2898/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2898/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2898/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2898", "id": 629367691, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2MjkzNjc2OTE=", "number": 2898, "title": "[FR] Run Docker with -t argument", "user": {"login": "Zethson", "id": 21954664, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTU0NjY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21954664?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson", "html_url": "https://github.com/Zethson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2022851725, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDIyODUxNzI1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/area/docker", "name": "area/docker", "color": "ede978", "default": false, "description": "Docker use anywhere, such as MLprojects and MLmodels"}, {"id": 955449434, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTU0NDk0MzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "Zethson", "id": 21954664, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTU0NjY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21954664?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson", "html_url": "https://github.com/Zethson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Zethson", "id": 21954664, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTU0NjY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21954664?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson", "html_url": "https://github.com/Zethson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Zethson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2020-06-02T17:07:12Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-10T23:36:52Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-10T23:36:52Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes.

Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [ ] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nCurrently, the create_experiment method uses artifact_location=None as a default argument. It would be better if by default the system tried to read the value for MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI from the environment and uses none if that is not found.\r\n\r\nbasically just replace :\r\ndef create_experiment(name, artifact_location=os.environ['MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI']):\r\n\r\nby this\r\ndef create_experiment(name, artifact_location=os.getenv('MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI', None)):\r\n\r\n(In a few sentences, provide a clear, high-level description of the feature request)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature? - Instead of having None as the default value for artifact URI, and then user having to remember where they want their data to be saved and pass it in - it would be easier if the value was read from the environment and None only be used if the corresponding var is not found.\r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nWe might have a default artifact uri - where all your final artifacts should be saved. In this case, we either set the environment variable or can pass it in. By default, the variable is None right now, in which case it doesn't read from the environment but creates an artifact folder in the current working direction/mlruns. However, many-a-times, especially if the artifact uri is an s3 bucket - its hard to remember the exact path. If the value is read by default, it will be one less thing to worry about the boilerplate - especially for new users. \r\n\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization? We have set out artifact_uri to be s3 bucket. It is hard to pass or remember to pass the artifact_uri every time an experiment is created, especially by users not familiar to mlflow\r\n\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient) - It is not difficult to fix it. Currently, we have patches for this. But would be more convenient if it was there in mlflow - since it would remove the need for unnecessary patches.\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [x] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.

This means our browsers are unable to help view the artifacts even if they are eg. images, or text files, or other files they can display nicely -- they will always just download. This applies to pre-signed urls generated for these objects, so generally including these in any web interfaces leads to a poor user experience. \r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [x] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThere is a relatively simple solution if we only want to tackle s3, but there are potential design considerations if this would be extended beyond s3, so I would like some input before opening a PR. One approach to this would be:\r\n\r\n1. Extend log_artifact signature to allow extra, optional kwargs: content_type, content_encoding.\r\n2. If given, respect the given values, and set these in the ExtraArgs dict: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/18eacdd9bde4e693942ff94882fb3da322b593c0/mlflow/store/artifact/s3_artifact_repo.py#L53-L57\r\n\r\nWe would merge these values with those given by `get_s3_file_upload_extra_args()`. \r\n\r\n3. If not given, use stdlib `mimetypes.guess_type` to guess these values, and set them:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontent_type, content_encoding = guess_type(local_file)\r\nif content_type is not None:\r\n    extra_args['ContentType'] = content_type\r\nif content_encoding is not None:\r\n    extra_args['ContentEncoding'] = content_encoding\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe open questions are:\r\n\r\n- Is this change the log_artifact signature acceptable?\r\n- Can the behaviour be to always guess the content type (awscli does this for cp command)?\r\n- Would adding this to s3 necessitate doing so for other artifact repository types?", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/2846", "id": 619900091, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2MTk5MDAwOTE=", "number": 2846, "title": "[FR] Start a mlflow model serve by config file", "user": {"login": "liuweibin6566396837", "id": 22042825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDQyODI1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22042825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837", "html_url": "https://github.com/liuweibin6566396837", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/liuweibin6566396837/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2022848902, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDIyODQ4OTAy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/area/scoring", "name": "area/scoring", "color": "48eabc", "default": false, "description": "Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs"}, {"id": 955449434, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTU0NDk0MzQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mlflow/mlflow/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2020-05-18T04:32:12Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-21T20:42:48Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-21T20:42:34Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Thank you for submitting a feature request. **Before proceeding, please review MLflow's [Issue Policy for feature requests](https://www.github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/ISSUE_POLICY.md#feature-requests) and the [MLflow Contributing Guide](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**.\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this feature request template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n## Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions.

We can't use raw gunicorn option like `--config`, so `access.log` or `error.log` can't be seen if we want.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nI found out `mlflow models serve` use gunicorn to create models service in linux. Howere the options for users is limited. When I request the models service by api, I can't see access.log or error.log in  models service.

It computes `restored_epoch = stopped_epoch - max(1, patience)` which produces incorrect epoch number if there was no early stopping.

contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages new feature contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute an implementation of this feature (either as an MLflow Plugin or an enhancement to the MLflow code base)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute this feature independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute this feature with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute this feature at this time.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\n\r\nThe experiment list sidebar is fixed width and truncates long experiment names, making it difficult to sift through. It would be nice to be able to have a resizable sidebar which I could use to look through my experiments easier\r\n\r\n<img width=\"566\" alt=\"mlflow-experiment-list-ui\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64787634/81738566-e43d8200-9467-11ea-9c36-4271c4a932bb.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n- What is the use case for this feature?\r\nAllows for longer experiment names to be practical. Enables prefixing experiment names with things like username, issue numbers, architecture, and other meta-information.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for MLflow users in general?\r\nAllows users to have more freedom in how they choose to name experiments.\r\n- Why is this use case valuable to support for your project(s) or organization?\r\nI would like to prefix my experiment names and currently that would make them too long to appear nicely in the UI.\r\n- Why is it currently difficult to achieve this use case? (please be as specific as possible about why related MLflow features and components are insufficient)\r\nIf I have many experiments which are named \"\\<username\\>/\\<issue name\\>/\\<experiment name\\>\" then they will appear truncated in the UI and I am unable to see the descriptive part of the name. Hovering over many of these would be cumbersome to finding the one I want. Additionally, I cannot easily set or search through experiment tags in the UI, so the name is the only place to store information about an experiment.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"248\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 3 48 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64787634/81738659-0d5e1280-9468-11ea-8218-0c05ef9915c5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this feature affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for\r\nModel Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: Local serving, model deployment tools, spark UDFs\r\n- [ ] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterfaces\r\n- [x] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, JavaScript, plotting\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n(Use this section to include any additional information about the feature.
