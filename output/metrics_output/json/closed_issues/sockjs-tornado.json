It works fine on development environment. Now I would like to make some load tests, eg. to test the limit of concurrent connections on production server. As far as I know I can't use browser script because of max concurrent connections limitation, and the sockjs-client seems to require browser to run (there are some window.document references). I tried to run it from node.js but it returns with code 2000 - no transports found. \r\n\r\nSo my question is what is the best strategy to simulate large number od sockjs connections messages? Do you have any advice or examples (eg. a script, Artillery setup) to run multiple clients simultaneously? If I come up with something I can post it here but any tips will be very appreciated. \r\n\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url":

They gave me an https:// url and I was able to build a very simple application that is able to connect to that service in JS using the SockJS client library.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am trying to connect to it in C# and I'm not sure that the SockJS library available for c# actually works.\r\n\r\nI've read that any SockJS server is available to connect over wss:// and when looking in my browser when running my JS application I see a connection to a wss:// server but I haven't been able to find the 'initial' URL. By the time the wss:// url shows up in Chrome it already has a session id on it and looks like this:\r\n\r\nwss://hostname/ws/050/k2p35oq0/websocket so what URL would I use for just an initial websocket connection to this service on? Thanks for any help you can provide me with.\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/491", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/491/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/491/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/491/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/491", "id": 511107341, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1MTExMDczNDE=", "number": 491, "title": "Refused to display 'http://jpt.jdbao168.com/endpoint/iframe.html#qd1bmcat' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'.", "user": {"login": "sjoooo123", "id": 22810581, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyODEwNTgx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22810581?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123", "html_url": "https://github.com/sjoooo123", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sjoooo123/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2249011144, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjQ5MDExMTQ0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/labels/no-issue-activity", "name": "no-issue-activity", "color": "ededed", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2019-10-23T06:35:30Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-08T00:42:07Z", "closed_at": "2020-08-08T00:42:07Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/489", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/489/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/489/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/489/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/489", "id": 497833839, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0OTc4MzM4Mzk=", "number": 489, "title": "Multiple Websocket connections", "user": {"login": "dennislabajo", "id": 12959753, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5NzUz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12959753?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo", "html_url": "https://github.com/dennislabajo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dennislabajo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 2249011144, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjQ5MDExMTQ0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/labels/no-issue-activity", "name": "no-issue-activity", "color": "ededed", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2019-09-24T17:47:22Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-08T00:42:07Z", "closed_at": "2020-08-08T00:42:07Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Is there a way or feature I can use to tell how many websocket connections the client has made to the server?

there.

Spring Boot 2.0.0 Release as backend, SockjsClient 1.1.4, StompJs 2.3.3.\r\nI want to use token based (jwt) authentication while connecting to websocket. As you may know, STOMP does not support http headers, so I would like to send my token in payload. Then, I will parse the `nativeHeaders` of payload within my `ChannelInterceptor` class. However,\r\n\r\nWhen STOMP tries to connect websocket, it fails and the consol output is below.\r\n```\r\nOpening Web Socket...stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\nXHRGET http://192.168.0.58:8080/api/v3/websocket/info?t=1523523409064 [HTTP/1.1 200  14ms]\r\nXHRGET http://192.168.0.58:8080/api/v3/websocket/181/q2ln1go4/eventsource \r\nXHRGET http://192.168.0.58:8080/api/v3/websocket/181/ebux3w0b/eventsource\r\nXHRPOST http://192.168.0.58:8080/api/v3/websocket/181/s5uv2w1e/xhr?t=1523523412548\r\nWhoops! Lost connection to http://192.168.0.58:8080/api/v3/websocket stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf, I make wait 2 seconds before returning the info request on Server side, STOMP successfully connects and subscribes. The console output;\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpening Web Socket... stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\nXHRGET http://192.168.0.58:8080/api/v3/websocket/info?t=1523523529512  [HTTP/1.1 200  2012ms]\r\nWeb Socket Opened...  stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\n>>> CONNECT\r\nx-auth-token:{{my_token}}\r\naccept-version:1.1,1.0\r\nheart-beat:0,10000\r\n\ufffd                                                 stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\n<<< CONNECTED\r\nversion:1.1\r\nheart-beat:0,0\r\nuser-name:admin\r\n\ufffd                                                  stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\nconnected to server undefined       stomp.min.js:8:1737\r\n>>> SUBSCRIBE\r\nid:sub-0\r\ndestination:/user/queue/admin\r\n\ufffd\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes anyone has an idea? Also I'm wondering what is the purpose of `/eventsource` requests? Because, if I wait 2 seconds or not, the response of `/info` requests same. If server returns 10-20ms, stomp starts to make `/eventsource` request, however If the response of` /info` requests took ~2 seconds, it did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49774655/spring-security-and-websocket-with-jwt-token", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/426", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/426/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/426/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/426/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/426", "id": 311944995, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMTE5NDQ5OTU=", "number": 426, "title": "React Native.
