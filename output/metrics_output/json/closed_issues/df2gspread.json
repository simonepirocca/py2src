https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/python\n- https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/installed-app\n\nBut I'm not able to find the \"Installed application\" option in this step:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1098323/10216792/e271c3fe-682b-11e5-8334-27e3d5f33870.png)\n\nIs it still available for you?\nOr was there a change, which is not reflected yet in Google docs?\n## `oauth2client.file` module problems\n\nIn parallel I've tested the basic steps in an interactive IPython session, and stumbled over this problem:\n\n```\nIn [1]: import oauth2client, os\nIn [2]: CLIENT_SECRET_FILE = os.path.expanduser('~/.gdrive_private')\nIn [3]: DEFAULT_TOKEN = os.path.expanduser('~/.oauth/drive.json')\nIn [4]: store = oauth2client.file.Storage(DEFAULT_TOKEN)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-4-28c0bcf4ba8d> in <module>()\n----> 1 store = oauth2client.file.Storage(DEFAULT_TOKEN)\n\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'file'\n```\n\nThis irritates me, because \"file.py\" is in the lib and can be imported like this:\n\n```\nIn [5]: from oauth2client import file\nIn [6]: oauth2client.file\nOut[6]: <module 'oauth2client.file' from 'C:\\Anaconda230-64bit\\lib\\site-packages\\oauth2client\\file.pyc'>\n```\n## next steps\n\nWould be great, if we can figure out this basics together.\nI'm really interested in the Google Drive / Pandas integration, but struggled with the OAuth2 4 months ago... and now it is blocking me again.\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url":
