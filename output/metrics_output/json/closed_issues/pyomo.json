IMO, attempting to test anything beyond this (e.g., an output baseline) would require too much work on the part of contributors.\r\n\r\nThere are two issues that I can think of that complicate this:\r\n\r\n 1. How do we execute an example?\r\n\r\n    I think the answer is that for each example, we convert the .ipynb file into a temporary script using the the commnd: `jupyter nbconvert --to script [filename].ipynb`. As long is we can install jupyter on Travis, this seems like a straightforward thing to do.\r\n\r\n 2. When do these tests get executed?\r\n\r\n    Obviously, when someone pushes a new example to this repo. However, we really want to be testing after pushes to the Pyomo/pyomo master branch, just like we should be testing Pyomo/pyomo after pushes to Pyutilib/pyutilib master. It looks like we are currently not doing this (with Travis / Appveyor at least), so it makes me think it is not currently possible. @whart222, @jsiirola : Do either of you know if this is possible?\r\n\r\n    I suppose it's also reasonable that we only test examples against the latest Pyomo release. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}]}
