By default all our region's GPO policy's set the CbtHardeningLevel to Strict expect for our development region. Unfortunately python-ntlm3 requests-ntlm and pywinrm do not support this feature making it a no go for me and others that use Windows in our environment.\n\nI've had a very brief play with editing python-ntlm3 to support this going by what I read on a ruby project that has added support for this security feature https://github.com/WinRb/rubyntlm/issues/27 but I am fairly new to Python and this is largely out of my depth. I also don't know if this library is still active and in development.\n\nThere is a library by @ianclegg https://github.com/ianclegg/ntlmlib that says supports CBT but the code for this seems to not be fully there (https://github.com/ianclegg/ntlmlib/blob/master/ntlmlib/authentication.py line 181) so I am not sure on the status.\n\nIs there anyone that would be able to help me get this added as I feel like this would be a importance feature for large to enterprise companies to adopt Ansible.

The first one that when I use ntlm auth with https I keep getting 407\n\nso I have:\nsession.proxies = {'http': 'http://ip:port', 'https': 'https://ip:port'}\nsession.auth = HttpNtlmAuth('domain\\user', 'password', session)\n\nand when I try:\nsession.get('https://www.google.com') I get:\nConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', error('Tunnel connection failed: 407 Unauthorized',)))\n\nI'm pretty sure this is due to the reason explained in here: https://lukasa.co.uk/2013/07/Python_Requests_And_Proxies/\nand indeed, if I remove the https entry from the proxy list, I get a 200 response. Now, this only works when I turn the firewall off, otherwise I get:\nConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', error(10013, 'An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions'))\nhttp is the only way I can get through the ntlm proxy with the firewall on\n\nThe real issue is when I try to use auth on a resource. Like I have a cloudant db and I use requests to query it, using session.auth to store the cloudant username and password.

These are requests to a REST interface with different URLs, say http://host/url_A?q_A and http://host/url_B?q_B.\n\nMy testing shows that these somewhat parallel requests sometimes work and other times get 401s. Following some investigation and digging through the code (both requests-ntlm and requests) I learned that:\n- NTLM authentication is done on a per-connection basis.\n- The auth process is completed after three request/responses on the connection.\n- The currently published code does not ensure the same connection is reused (but pull request #51 does).\n- The underlying requests (urllib3 actually) pool manager only returns connections from the pool on a hostname basis and not on a full-url basis.\n\nThis results in connections A (say for http://host/url_A?q_A) and B (for http://host/url_B?q_B) being switched along the three request/responses and, of course, leading to a failure.\n\nIf this is correct, would you have any suggestion on how to address my challenge?

Not sure if broken proxy or false assumption.\n\nPossibly related with https://github.com/requests/requests-ntlm/issues/36\n\nI'm behind evil corporate NTLM proxy. While within session I would request a page (successfully), grab it's content to get form postdata and finally send new request which would end up with this error:\n\n```\nres = s.post(url, data=formdata, stream=True)\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 498, in post\nreturn self.request('POST', url, data=data, **kwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 456, in request\nresp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\sessions.py\", line 565, in send\nr = dispatch_hook('response', hooks, r, **kwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\hooks.py\", line 41, in dispatch_hook\n_hook_data = hook(hook_data, **kwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests_ntlm\\requests_ntlm.py\", line 126, in response_hook\nkwargs)\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests_ntlm\\requests_ntlm.py\", line 91, in retry_using_http_NTLM_auth\nauth_header_value = response2.headers[auth_header_field]\nFile \"C:\\Python2\\lib\\site-packages\\requests\\structures.py\", line 77, in __getitem__\nreturn self._store[key.lower()][1]\nKeyError: 'proxy-authenticate'\n```\n\nWith the help of a friend I digged into it and found out, that request gets 407 response, hook is dispatched and caught by response_hook to call retry_using_http_NTLM_auth(). That function makes assumption that it needs to first send NTLM negotiate message, receives challenge in response2, builds new request with NTLM authenticate and finally gets real content in response3.\n\nInstead of challenge, what I really got in response2 was real content. Response2.header thus did not contain any key 'proxy-authenticate' (auth_header_value) hence the error. I made a dirty but working workaround and changed + added code from line 91:\n\n```\nauth_header_value = response2.headers.get(auth_header_field) \nif not auth_header_value:\n    return response2\n```\n\nI'm really unsure why our proxy behaves like this - could be just bad implementation that breaks some NTLM protocol rule (please let me know, if it does, so I can yell at our IT) or just wrong assumption from the author/s. I'm not very good programmer hence why I created issue and not pull request. Hopefully you can dig into this and create better patch (or tell me to yell at our IT instead).\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/requests/requests-ntlm/issues/48", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/requests/requests-ntlm", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/requests/requests-ntlm/issues/48/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/requests/requests-ntlm/issues/48/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/requests/requests-ntlm/issues/48/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/requests/requests-ntlm/issues/48", "id": 41073684, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0MTA3MzY4NA==", "number": 48, "title": "Fix versioning", "user": {"login": "btoews", "id": 1144197, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQxOTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1144197?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews", "html_url": "https://github.com/btoews", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/btoews/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2014-08-25T15:38:23Z", "updated_at": "2014-08-25T15:44:48Z", "closed_at": "2014-08-25T15:44:48Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Rather than going from `0.0.2.4` to `0.0.2.5`, I'd like to bump to `0.0.3`.

When you run this script, your server is likely to tell you that the final request (actually putting the payload) has an incorrect HTTP method.  This is because the content-length is set to 5, but the file-like object has already been read (it was included with the first PUT, which was not yet authorized).  An incorrect content-length can break the server's http parsing altogether.  With IIS you get \"The request verb is invalid\" because \"PUT\" plus a few more bytes get consumed, the path ends up getting treated as the verb, and \"HTTP/1.1\" ends up getting treated as the path.\n\nA hacky way to fix this would be to seek(0) on the request.data before doing the final request.  But that would suck for large files (which would still be needlessly sent on the first request).  And it would be impossible for dynamically-produced file-like objects that don't support seek().\n\nThe better way to fix this would be for requests to offer a pre-send hook where requests-ntlm could alter the request on the way out if it doesn't yet have a NTLM Authorization header.
