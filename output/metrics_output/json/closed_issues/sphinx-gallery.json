This is the easiest way to use plotly figures, but then you don't get png files saved for the thumbnails\r\n- or use a custom scraper provided by the plotly package, which saves both png and html files. For this scraper to work you need to install the `orca` package which is easy to install with conda but with pip you need to install other dependencies (basically because you need a browser to run to save a figure as png). We're planning to make this process easier (ie pip-installable) in the coming months.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to write an example for the sphinx-gallery website using just `_repr_html_` since it's easy to do, and to mention that the scraper exists if you want to get the png thumbnails as well.

The documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs (RTD)](https://pystiche.readthedocs.io/en/latest/galleries/examples/index.html). My examples rely on a GPU, so I can't let them be built by RTD.\r\n\r\nI came up with the following to overcome this: I've set up a separate build server that spins up every few hours and runs a `sphinx-gallery` build for the current `master`. Afterwards the generated galleries are uploaded. Within the `conf.py` I detect if a build is performed by RTD and download the pre-built galleries instead. \r\n\r\nI've ran into the following problems:\r\n\r\n1. I need to set `plot_gallery=False` since the pre-built galleries might not match the examples in the current commit. If I don't RTD tries to rebuild the changed examples, which will fail. Still, sometimes it recompiles the galleries without running them. I've yet to figure out how to reproduce this. I think it detects non-matching checksums, but I'm not sure yet. Unfortunately this removes the output from the pre-built galleries, defeating their purpose.\r\n2. In response to 1. I've tried to remove the `\"sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery\"` from the `extensions` if run by RTD with moderate success. The output is preserved, but I think some \"style files\" (not sure if this is the correct term) are missing. For example the background color of the output blocks is no longer yellow, the thumbnails in the gallery are no longer clickable, and so on.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to overcome these issues? Can I for example force `sphinx-gallery` to accept the pre-built galleries or copy the \"style files\" without executing the scripts?\r\n\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/697", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/697/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/697/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/697/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/697", "id": 625050853, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2MjUwNTA4NTM=", "number": 697, "title": "DOC Builder types clarification", "user": {"login": "lucyleeow", "id": 23182829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTgyODI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/23182829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow", "html_url": "https://github.com/lucyleeow", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucyleeow/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 434134616, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw0MzQxMzQ2MTY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/labels/documentation", "name": "documentation", "color": "5319e7", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-05-26T17:21:05Z", "updated_at": "2020-05-26T18:18:54Z", "closed_at": "2020-05-26T18:18:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Our doc intro says:\r\n\r\n> Sphinx-Gallery is a Sphinx extension that builds an HTML gallery of examples from any set of Python scripts.\r\n\r\nbut technically once we make the .rst files Sphinx can convert them to many different outputs?

[mini-galleries](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/configuration.html#add-mini-galleries-for-api-documentation), but I found the procedure for insertion to be a little clunky, and the mini-gallery to be a little limiting.  I wrote [a Sphinx directive for SunPy](https://github.com/ayshih/sunpy/blob/c7f8cb2776acb21a9029e943c868503772740b2b/docs/conf.py#L320), with the following advantages:\r\n\r\n- No need to specify the backreferences directory or the `.examples` suffix\r\n- No potential omission of the `<div class=\"sphx-glr-clear\">` HTML block\r\n- Removes the heading from the backreferences file (in case it doesn't match the desired heading level)\r\n- If multiple inputs are provided (separated by spaces), the output mini-gallery concatenates all of the relevant examples\r\n\r\nLive example ([found here](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/code_ref/coordinates/rotatedsunframe.html#example-uses-of-rotatedsunframe)):\r\n```rst\r\n.. minigallery:: sunpy.coordinates.RotatedSunFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombining multiple (possibly unrelated) objects into single mini-gallery:\r\n```rst\r\n.. minigallery:: sunpy.coordinates.sun.earth_distance sunpy.coordinates.transform_with_sun_center\r\n```\r\n\r\nUseful for when the same object can be accessed from multiple namespaces:\r\n```rst\r\n.. minigallery:: sunpy.coordinates.RotatedSunFrame sunpy.coordinates.metaframes.RotatedSunFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould `sphinx-gallery` be interested in including such a directive (i.e, upstreamed from SunPy)?  It would need to be modified to be a bit more general and robust, of course.

scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4613) showing that thumbnails are responsible for long loading time and large bandwidth consumption. Comments show that scikit-learn and matplotlib are also affected by this issue.\r\n\r\nI made some tests and the mitigation I found on the user side is to reduce slightly the default resolution of the thumbnails. As our galleries are expected to grow, I think that a longer term solution would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI read the sphinx-gallery code and saw that you are using your own thumbnail generator, relaying on pillow. So far, thumbnails are saved in png (because our plots with matplotlib are so), which is particularly good for rendering edges and fonts. The drawback is the file size as explained above. I made some tests with pillow and I couldn't reach better performances while keeping a png format.\r\n\r\nHave you ever considered to switch to jpg? Jpg has some advantages such as a good compression level (with loss) and also [progressive loading](https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/09/lazy-loading-http-range-requests/).

E.g.,\r\n```# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 'path/to/figure.png'```\r\n\r\nThese are some related issues/PRs I found, but none of them resolves it. #5 actually already suggested similar things, but it was closed then referring to the then introduced scraper API.

I was able to make my example run by adding:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport typing\r\ntyping.TYPE_CHECKING=False\r\n```\r\n\r\nas the first cell. Then the import of the package works normally.

Since we don't allow for things like directives, you can't say \"show the example gallery for these python files here, and those python files there\" super easily.\r\n\r\nOne way to get around this would be to build all of the gallery code for sub-galleries (e.g. those within sub-folders of the main gallery folder) as separate text files, and then **include** them in the built gallery (minus the label). This would let users add the sub-galleries in other places if they so-wished.\r\n\r\n## An example\r\n\r\nFor example, in the SG repo, we have the `sin_func` sub-folder in [the examples folder](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/tree/master/examples). When the gallery is built, the gallery for the `sin_func` folder is placed within `index.rst` in a block like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...other gallery code...\r\n\r\n.. _sin_examples:\r\n\r\nThe sin function\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nSpecific examples for the sin function. Saved in the examples\r\ndirectory in a subfolder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.. raw:: html\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"sphx-glr-thumbcontainer\" tooltip=\"A simple example of the plot of a sin function in order to test the autonomy of the gallery.\">\r\n\r\n.. only:: html\r\n\r\n    .. figure:: /auto_examples/sin_func/images/thumb/sphx_glr_plot_sin_thumb.png\r\n\r\n        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_sin_func_plot_sin.py`\r\n\r\n.. raw:: html\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n.. toctree::\r\n   :hidden:\r\n\r\n   /auto_examples/sin_func/plot_sin\r\n\r\n.. raw:: html\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"sphx-glr-thumbcontainer\" tooltip=\"A simple example of the plot of a sin function on a black background\">\r\n\r\n...rest of gallery code...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that the rST for the `sin_func` gallery is interwoven with the gallery for the entire `examples` folder. What if the user wanted to highlight only the `sin_func` folder in a location in their docs? If instead we put the `sin_func` rST in a separate folder (e.g. in `sin_func/index.txt`) and then included it in the main `index.rst` file like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...other gallery code...\r\n\r\n.. _sin_examples:\r\n\r\n.. include:: sin_func/index.txt\r\n\r\n...rest of gallery code...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen people could choose to include the `sin_func` mini-gallery wherever they like.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?
