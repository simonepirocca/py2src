hooked objects hard to document with sphinx and autodoc. This is especially true because you can't assign to `__doc__` of either object.\r\n\r\nCan they be changed to automatically expose the `__doc__` of their (original?) implementation function?\r\n\r\nIf you do that you can use `.. autofunction:: the.hooked.function` (it won't be picked up by `.. automodule::` because it's not any kind of recognized type; treating it like a constant or data value and using the `#: special comments` doesn't work either).\r\n\r\nIf you format your docstring so the first line is a signature, you can stop there. If you don't, you'll get a warning that the object has no `__bases__`; you can ignore that or you can add one if the warning bothers you. For full generality (that I've found so far) you need to expose both `__bases__` and `__dict__`. I do this with a subclass:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass _hookable(_base_hookable):\r\n    __doc__ = property(lambda self: self.original.__doc__)\r\n    __bases__ = property(lambda _: ())\r\n    __dict__ = property(lambda _: None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I imagine most people would be happy to just have them get documented and ignore the warning.\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.hookable/issues/4", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.hookable", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.hookable/issues/4/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.hookable/issues/4/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zopefoundation/zope.hookable/issues/4/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.hookable/issues/4", "id": 246030506, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyNDYwMzA1MDY=", "number": 4, "title": "Automate Windows wheels with appveyor", "user": {"login": "mgedmin", "id": 159967, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTk2Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/159967?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin", "html_url": "https://github.com/mgedmin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgedmin/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2017-07-27T12:56:27Z", "updated_at": "2017-07-27T15:15:30Z", "closed_at": "2017-07-27T13:51:56Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "zope.hookable contains C extensions which means pip installing it on Windows causes pain.\r\n\r\nWe could copy appveyor configs from e.g. zope.interface and set up automated wheel builds.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}]}
