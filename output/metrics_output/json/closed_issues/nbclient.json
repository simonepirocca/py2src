If a notebook exceed the allocated memory (of the container) only the notebook subprocess seems to be killed (or dies), this seems to be not detected by nbclient, resulting in an infinite running process.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport nbformat\r\nfrom nbclient import NotebookClient\r\n\r\nprint(\"Start\")\r\nwith open(\"test_notebook.ipynb\") as f:\r\n    nb = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)\r\n\r\nclient = NotebookClient(nb, kernel_name=\"python3\")\r\nclient.execute()\r\n\r\nprint(\"Done\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue can be reproduced in two ways, with the script above:\r\n\r\n- Running a python debuger, setting a breakpoint here https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/blob/master/nbclient/client.py#L521 and killing the subprocess by hand using the system monitor, and then continuing execution. _Note: This can create the same type of issue (stuck in an infinite loop), but the solution might not completely overlap with the issue we are experiencing._\r\n- Or using the following steps with docker. :\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nFirst ensure that \"cgroup swap limit capabilities\" are enabled (if you have a lot of swap space). I used Ubuntu. See here for more info:\r\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#your-kernel-does-not-support-cgroup-swap-limit-capabilities\r\n\r\nCreate the following files\r\n\r\nDockerfile:\r\n```docker\r\nFROM python:3\r\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\r\nRUN pip install numpy ipykernel nbclient\r\nCOPY . .\r\nCMD [ \"python\", \"./test.py\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\ntest_notebook.ipynb:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ntest = np.random.random((110, 10000000))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild and run docker container (this will result in an infinite running process):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker build -t my-python-app .\r\ndocker run -it --memory-swap 1000m --memory 1000m --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun docker container without any issues:\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThe issue may be caused by a missing timeout on the following line, but adding a timeout does not work for me:\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/blob/4314a44b3074cfedd4d05128d81765b285194ab8/nbclient/client.py#L627", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url":

Still looking into why this is the case (is this intended? possibly an issue on my end)\r\n- When I run the above, but with `reset_kc=True`, I run into a lot of issues, first of which is that in execute, `self.kc` has not been initialized from the class before `self._async_cleanup_kernel` is called, so that fails and while it's handling that failure, it fails again on `self.km.cleanup()` since `self.km` doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nI am using an unusual KernelManager, but I don't think that's the cause of these issues.\r\n\r\nCouple other things I noticed; the changelog link is broken, and there's a typo in the docstring for NotebookClient (Kernel spelled Kernerl)", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/49", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/49/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/49/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/49/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/issues/49", "id": 614198497, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2MTQxOTg0OTc=", "number": 49, "title": "Any interest in the sphinx-book-theme for docs?", "user": {"login": "choldgraf", "id": 1839645, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1839645?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf", "html_url": "https://github.com/choldgraf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2020-05-07T16:45:22Z", "updated_at": "2020-05-07T20:13:32Z", "closed_at": "2020-05-07T20:12:58Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "We've been working on a simple sphinx theme for the jupyter-book rewrite that I've also found useful for other documentation sites as well (sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io)\r\n\r\nI find the Alabaster theme to be a little bit cluttered and hard to parse sometimes...would folks be interested in a PR that updates the docs theme for nbclient to the sphinx-book-theme?

"I've already mentioned this in https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/pull/12#discussion_r377018971, but I think this deserves its own issue.\r\n\r\nDuring the move from `nbconvert` to `nbclient`, the `Executor` class evolved into something that's not really a meaningful class anymore. Instead, it is something that takes a few input parameters and produces an output. In other words, it turned into a function disguised as a class.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly visible by its usage here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/blob/ad2eba76bd0307ffd7b04e936f9dbe5b1a32d21e/nbclient/execute.py#L721\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat better in `nbconvert` (see https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/8c9bffc8deb65ced99b20684ddd148fd885ad9e8/nbconvert/preprocessors/execute.py#L765-L766):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    ep = ExecutePreprocessor(**kwargs)\r\n    return ep.preprocess(nb, resources, km=km)[0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think there are two possible ways to improve this, I don't know which one is better in this case:\r\n\r\n1. Get rid of the `Executor` class and implement everything in the stand-alone `execute()` function. This would of course become a huge function, so probably some parts of it should be factored out in separate (probably internal) functions and classes.\r\n\r\n2. Make the `Executor` great again. An `Executor` class should be instantiated with some set of options and it should provide an `execute()` method that can be repeatedly (and ideally concurrently) be used to execute multiple notebooks with those given options.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/14", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/14/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/14/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/nbclient/issues/14/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/issues/14", "id": 560315697, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1NjAzMTU2OTc=", "number": 14, "title": "Why isn't this project called \"nbexecute\"?", "user": {"login": "mgeier", "id": 705404, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQwNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/705404?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier", "html_url": "https://github.com/mgeier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mgeier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2020-02-05T11:39:29Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-31T19:54:29Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-31T19:54:28Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I was wondering what `nbclient` is supposed to do except executing ... and I asked there: https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/issues/4#issuecomment-579499964\r\n\r\nThis was answered by @MSeal in https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient/issues/4#issuecomment-581790592:\r\n\r\n> For now the intention is to have a very narrow scoped notebook executor that has few dependencies, like jupyter_client does for interacting with kernels.
