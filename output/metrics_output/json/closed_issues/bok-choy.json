To fix it, an update to bok-choy will be necessary (which may be a bit tricky since the actual use of FirefoxDriver is done through the needle package)\n\nThe fix for this is to use GeckoDriver/Marionette.  Unlike FirefoxDriver, this component is not bundled inside the selenium package.  It's more like Chrome/ChromeDriver, where you install a separate package to use the driver.  (note: GeckoDriver used to be called Wires, so you might not find much info yet if you search the interwebz for \"GeckoDriver\")\n\nbtw, Mozilla and the Selenium maintainers have done a really poor job of publicizing and easing this transition... so expect some pain \ud83d\udc4a \n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edx/bok-choy/issues/150", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edx/bok-choy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edx/bok-choy/issues/150/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edx/bok-choy/issues/150/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/edx/bok-choy/issues/150/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/edx/bok-choy/issues/150", "id": 149468500, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNDk0Njg1MDA=", "number": 150, "title": "Fix confusing implementation of try_limit in Promises", "user": {"login": "jzoldak", "id": 2338889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzg4ODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2338889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak", "html_url": "https://github.com/jzoldak", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jzoldak/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2016-04-19T13:56:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-06-17T15:20:44Z", "closed_at": "2016-06-17T15:20:44Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The `__init.py__` method of the bok-choy Promise class [has a default value for timeout](https://github.com/edx/bok-choy/blob/master/bok_choy/promise.py#L37).
