"Currently the set methods union, intersection, difference, symmetric_difference return a set instead of an NGram instances.  Add NGram-specific overrides that return valid NGram instances for those methods.\n\nAlso, the methods pop and clear should maintain the state of the index consistent with the underlying set.\n\nAlso correct intersection_update to accept multiple other iterables as `set` does.\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url":
