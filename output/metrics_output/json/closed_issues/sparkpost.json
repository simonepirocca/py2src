`header_to` generated for the `cc`. If you omit the `cc` parameter, it works fine. Similarly, if you change to a simple `recipients=['to@example.com']`, the send is accepted (albeit without the intended substitution data).\n\nThis worked (or at least was accepted by the API) on 2016-06-07. I don't believe python-sparkpost has changed during that period. Is this a problem in python-sparkpost, or an intentional API clarification/change? If the latter, is there way to specify substitution_data and cc (or bcc) in the same transmission?\n\npython 3.5 (or 2.7); python-sparkpost 1.2.0\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/114", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/114/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/114/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/114/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/114", "id": 151187990, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNTExODc5OTA=", "number": 114, "title": "Problem with sending emails with emojis", "user": {"login": "spoof", "id": 90999, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTk5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/90999?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof", "html_url": "https://github.com/spoof", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spoof/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 171878943, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzE4Nzg5NDM=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "richleland", "id": 34866, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODY2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/34866?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland", "html_url": "https://github.com/richleland", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "richleland", "id": 34866, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODY2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/34866?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland", "html_url": "https://github.com/richleland", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richleland/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2016-04-26T17:05:42Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-06T19:51:11Z", "closed_at": "2017-05-06T19:51:11Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I got an issue with emails that contain emojis.

SparkPost seems like a good candidate, as it has a similar UI to Mandrill, has a generous free tier and a helpful migration tool. The latter is important, because businesses on the free tier probably don't want to spend a lot of time and money on switching.\n\nIt therefore makes sense that migrating the backend to SparkPost is easy too. [django-anymail](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail) has made it easy to migrate from djrill, a package which supported only Mandrill, to its ESP-agnostic interface, making it easy to switch to any one of a number of supported ESPs. However, SparkPost is not currently supported.\n\nThis is a shame. With support for SparkPost in django-anymail, it would make it easier still for django users to migrate from Mandrill to SparkPost.\n\nI've made [a request for its support on that repository](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail/issues/11), but I also thought it would be worth raising it with you here.\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/103", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/103/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/103/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/103/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/SparkPost/python-sparkpost/issues/103", "id": 146541334, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNDY1NDEzMzQ=", "number": 103, "title": "SparkPostAPIException: content.inline_images requires content.html", "user": {"login": "puttu", "id": 350913, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDkxMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/350913?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu", "html_url": "https://github.com/puttu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/puttu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2016-04-07T08:09:28Z", "updated_at": "2016-04-08T17:56:50Z", "closed_at": "2016-04-08T17:56:50Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I have a weird issue, preventing me from sending emails out with sparkpost==1.1.0 and Django==1.8.12.
