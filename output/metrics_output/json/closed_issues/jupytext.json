problem to #241. When the Jupytext metadata includes the file encoding, the leading comment for Python scripts is erroneously included in RMarkdown files.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce in JupyterLab:\r\n1. Create a notebook. A single markdown cell, with say \"\u03b1\", will suffice. The relevant Jupytext metadata is\r\n```\r\n \"metadata\": {\r\n  \"jupytext\": {\r\n   \"formats\": \"ipynb,Rmd\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n2. Pair the notebook with an RMarkdown file. Note that the export is fine; the RMarkdown looks as follows:\r\n```\r\n---\r\njupyter:\r\n  jupytext:\r\n    formats: ipynb,Rmd\r\n    text_representation:\r\n      extension: .Rmd\r\n      format_name: rmarkdown\r\n      format_version: '1.2'\r\n      jupytext_version: 1.5.0\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u03b1\r\n```\r\n3. Add an encoding entry to the metadata. One way to do this is:\r\n   1. Additionally pair the notebook with a Python script. It will include the line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` because of the unicode character.\r\n   2. Edit the *Python* script (e.g. write \"\u03b1b\") and save.\r\n   3. Reopen the notebook in Jupyter and save. A dialog will ask to overwrite; click yes. Now the notebook metadata reads\r\n```\r\n \"metadata\": {\r\n  \"jupytext\": {\r\n   \"encoding\": \"# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\",\r\n   \"formats\": \"ipynb,Rmd,py:light\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n4. In addition, the RMarkdown is now invalid because it begins with the Python encoding line:\r\n```\r\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\r\n---\r\njupyter:\r\n  jupytext:\r\n    formats: ipynb,Rmd,py:light\r\n    text_representation:\r\n      extension: .Rmd\r\n      format_name: rmarkdown\r\n      format_version: '1.2'\r\n      jupytext_version: 1.5.0\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u03b1b\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

Thus, when we run `isort` on a `.py` notebook, imports at the top of the cell are moved along the preceding cell marker (`# %%`  or `# +`), breaking the corresponding cell.\r\n\r\nPossibly one way to fix this is to insert one blank line between the cell marker and the cell content. I'll see if we can add an option to do that, and if `isort` works better, then. Does this option work well with `black`? If so, it should be made the default for when a notebook is piped into an other command.\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/552", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/552/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/552/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/552/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/552", "id": 649995172, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NDk5OTUxNzI=", "number": 552, "title": "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'toml'", "user": {"login": "IanEdington", "id": 6425087, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjUwODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6425087?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington", "html_url": "https://github.com/IanEdington", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/IanEdington/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/milestones/24", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/milestone/24", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/milestones/24/labels", "id": 5610588, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTYxMDU4OA==", "number": 24, "title": "1.5.1", "description": null, "creator": {"login": "mwouts", "id": 29915202, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTE1MjAy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29915202?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 1, "state": "open", "created_at": "2020-07-02T15:24:48Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-05T16:27:02Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-07-02T14:54:44Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-05T16:31:58Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-05T16:27:02Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I ran into an issue on first install of `jupytext`, awesome project by the way \ud83d\udcaf\r\n\r\nInstalling the missing dependency solved my issue but figured I would flag it for you.

I am working with a colleague @nkorinek and each time he pushes a notebook + md or py, and i try to open a notebook i get the error below: \r\n\r\n```\r\nFile python-fundamentals-variables.py is in format/version=light/1.5 (current version is 1.4). It would not be safe to override the source of python-fundamentals-variables.ipynb with that file. Please remove one or the other file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe notebook can not be opened until i delete said .py or md file. We have worked around it but i see I have `format_version` 1.4 and he has 1.5 (looking at the .py file metadata at the top). He is on linux i believe and I am mac. \r\n\r\nive tried to reinstall from `conda-forge` (was previously installed via pip) but that does not help. how do i upgrade whatever format_Version is calling? i've gone through the docs and see discussion of the format version but don't see how i can align version (upgrade to 1.5!) with my colleagues for seamless collaboration! Many thanks for any suggestions. \r\n\r\na bit more information - here is my environment.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(base) CIRES-EL-LM-020:edsc-summer-2020 leahwasser$ conda list\r\n# packages in environment at

editing the python script of a notebook in PyCharm and the notebook itself in jupyterlab. A major use case is to use PyCharms refactoring capabilities, to rename variables etc. Refactorings may hit several notebooks at once, for example if I rename functions in modules used across the notebooks of an entire project.\r\n\r\nThe problem: If I go back from the script level to notebooks with jupytext --sync, the output of all cell affected by refactorings is lost - I end up with possibly several notebooks which have lost output in a few cells each, which means I need to rerun them all again before sharing with collaborators. However, since I am only doing basic refactoring, I am (sufficiently) sure that the outputs won't change.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to allow keeping cell outputs on user request, as long as some conditions are met (e.g. the number and order of cells does not change, just the content of cells)? Maybe this is already possible and I missed it - in this case sorry for the lengthy prelude!\r\n\r\nSomething similar is already possible with jupytext --pipe, but this functionality seems to be geared towards code formatters and similar tools.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that PyCharm may allow directly refactoring notebooks in the future (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-30784), however this will be a Pro feature if I am not mistaken, and it will also not cover users of other IDEs/editors.\r\n\r\nThank you!", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/462", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/462/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/462/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/462/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/462", "id": 584143357, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1ODQxNDMzNTc=", "number": 462, "title": "jupytext.write doesn't error if `fmt` is unknown, but the output file has a known extension", "user": {"login": "choldgraf", "id": 1839645, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1839645?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf", "html_url": "https://github.com/choldgraf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/milestones/22", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/milestone/22", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/milestones/22/labels", "id": 5216540, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTIxNjU0MA==", "number": 22, "title": "1.4.2", "description": null, "creator": {"login": "mwouts", "id": 29915202, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTE1MjAy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29915202?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 8, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2020-03-19T07:53:38Z", "updated_at": "2020-04-05T17:28:22Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2020-04-05T17:28:22Z"}, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2020-03-19T03:49:52Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-28T16:55:13Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-28T16:55:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Just playing around with MyST -> ipynb -> MyST right now.

Right now in Jupytext, the way to do this is to write `<!-- md -->` and `<!-- endmd -->`. This isn't bad, but it is a bit cumbersome. I find it much more streamlined to use the Pandoc syntax for `divs`, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:::md\r\n:::\r\n```\r\n\r\nas opposed to\r\n```\r\n<!-- #md -->\r\n<!-- #endmd -->\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be extended to other types as well, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:::raw\r\n:::\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about supporting syntax such as this for Jupytext markdown?\r\n\r\n**RMarkdown code blocks in markdown cells**\r\n\r\nAnother feature I love about RMarkdown is the ability to distinguish \"regular\" code blocks (using ```python) from \"runnable\" code blocks (using ```{python}). This could be a nice way to separate out the same behavior in Jupytext markdown.\r\n\r\nI'm curious what others think about incorporating these into the base flavor of Jupytext md (In addition to manually specifying with comments).", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/421", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/421/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/421/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/421/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/421", "id": 553759126, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1NTM3NTkxMjY=", "number": 421, "title": "Is the Rmd output a valid RMarkdown notebook?", "user": {"login": "choldgraf", "id": 1839645, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1839645?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf", "html_url": "https://github.com/choldgraf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2020-01-22T19:54:36Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-08T18:34:35Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-08T18:34:35Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "This might be an ill-posed question, but I am wondering whether the two-way conversion with RMarkdown formats totally matches the specification of [RMarkdown notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html).

interface and use the basic editor for readme files etc.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to configure Jupytext so that the classic interface still opens non `.ipynb` files using the `edit` instead of `notebooks` while still allowing for the right click --> open as notebook in the lab interface?\r\n\r\nCurrently the best option seems to be to use `c.ContentsManager.notebook_extensions = \"ipynb\"`

-->`).\r\n\r\nIt would be more user-friendly to offer a `active-md` tag or metadata to let Jupytext/Jupyter know that a given code chunk should not be executed in Jupyter.\r\n\r\nThe subject of inactive cells in Jupyter was discussed at https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/2125, but inactive cells were finally not coded in base Jupyter (only, in Jupyter notebook, the `runtools` extension allows to mark some code cells as inactive).\r\n\r\nIn Jupytext, inactive cells for the other formats are currently mapped to Raw cells, but maybe we should reconsider that (that representation is not compatible with nbconvert and will break #321). Should we map them to a Markdown cell instead?

It works great. i edit text and code, and the notebook magically \"updates\" with the content.\r\n\r\nHowever here is what i've been noticing. a few of my colleagues also working on this have been pushing up .md files but the notebooks are consistently out of sync. Looking at it closely on my computer i see the following happening.\r\n\r\n1. I work on a markdown file and save. my ipynb file updates in terms of content.\r\n2. BUT the file itself doesn't save properly with a checkpoint.  \r\n\r\nSo what happens in turn is git doesn't actually see the changes. This is super weird to me because the file itself HAS in fact changed. but i'm just wondering if git relies on those checkpoints to see the diff or ??? any thoughts anyone?\r\n\r\nNote below my screenshow where ou can see i've udpated a md file 2 minutes ago but the notebook was updated 4 hours ago. however again the TEXT in the notebook is in sync with the md file. \r\n  \r\n<img width=\"1008\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-07 at 2 24 33 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7649194/66346014-75ff7280-e90e-11e9-9ec4-d78d9b0ec6cc.png\">\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this?

I created two 'render engines', one based on `papermill` and one on `knitr`. \r\nIdeally, using jupytext, one could use them interchangeably on the same notebook. \r\n\r\nI am currently struggling with the cell metadata to control the visibility of cell inputs/outputs. I have seen that you have been experimenting with both papermill and jupyterbook. I also observed that you implemented some conversion of cell metadata for Rmarkdown. Ideally, there would be common conventions between jupytext, jupyterbook, Rmarkdown etc. \r\n\r\nFirst, my observations: \r\n* nbconvert supports contolling cell visibility when creating a html report by using [nbconvert.preprocessors.TagRemovePreprocessor](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/preprocessors.html#nbconvert.preprocessors.TagRemovePreprocessor)\r\n* Rmarkdown uses `include=FALSE` to hide an entire cell, `results='hide'` to hide output and `echo=FALSE` to hide input. \r\n* jupyter book supports `hide_input` and `remove_input` to hide the input, `remove_cell` for an entir cell, and to my knowledge no option to hide output only. \r\n* jupytext currently uses `hide_output` and `hide_input` when converting from Rmarkdown. \r\n\r\nNow, my questions/suggestsions: \r\n* Are you aware of more/different tags from other projects?\r\n* Did you come up with current jupytext `hide_output` and `hide_input`, or are they supposed to be compatible with another project? \r\n*  Rmarkdown `include=FALSE` translates currently into `hide_output`. I believe it should translate into `remove_cell` or equivalent. \r\n* Rmarkdown `results='hide'` is currently not converted. It should translate into `hide_output`. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think! \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nGregor", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/336", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/336/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/336/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/issues/336/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/336", "id": 496389128, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0OTYzODkxMjg=", "number": 336, "title": "Capture YAML header key/values that aren't in `jupyter:`?", "user": {"login": "choldgraf", "id": 1839645, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk2NDU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1839645?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf", "html_url": "https://github.com/choldgraf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/choldgraf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/milestones/13", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/milestone/13", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mwouts/jupytext/milestones/13/labels", "id": 4615451, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDYxNTQ1MQ==", "number": 13, "title": "1.3.0", "description": null, "creator": {"login": "mwouts", "id": 29915202, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTE1MjAy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29915202?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts", "html_url": "https://github.com/mwouts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mwouts/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 2, "closed_issues": 28, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2019-08-30T05:31:16Z", "updated_at": "2020-04-05T17:28:19Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2020-04-05T17:28:19Z"}, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2019-09-20T14:37:46Z", "updated_at": "2019-10-13T01:39:47Z", "closed_at": "2019-10-13T01:39:47Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I'm playing around with using Jupytext to read in content in Jupyter Book, and one challenge I've run into is that it seems only the keys/values in the `jupyter:` field for the front-matter YAML are retained when you read in a text file with Jupytext.

If it's originally a text file, check the resulting NotebookNode for any jupytext metadata. If that metadata exists, then do nothing.
