As I understood from the pallets blog post 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 are supposed to be compatible. I took a look in the repo and saw the changes made re: fallback signers, so apart from that the only variable I could obviously see which could be mismatched was the `algorithm_name`...but in both 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 they are already both set to `\"HS512\"`. My examples below:\r\n\r\n### in 1.0.0\r\n```python\r\nfrom itsdangerous import JSONWebSignatureSerializer\r\ns1 = JSONWebSignatureSerializer('a-key', salt='a-salt')\r\ns1.dumps({1:1}).decode('utf-8')\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ > eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyIxIjoxfQ.nKcizI38sjEbao_XTh9VB2vMZPYwVpoEpAJboU7BqOL7VpR-zFPyWkBzaryxrOvUKP9J74MnNIBNSOCj4ERQDQ\r\n```\r\n### in 1.1.0\r\n```python\r\nfrom itsdangerous import JSONWebSignatureSerializer\r\ns1 = JSONWebSignatureSerializer('a-key', salt='a-salt')\r\ns1.loads('eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyIxIjoxfQ.nKcizI38sjEbao_XTh9VB2vMZPYwVpoEpAJboU7BqOL7VpR-zFPyWkBzaryxrOvUKP9J74MnNIBNSOCj4ERQDQ')\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ > Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/huss/.virtualenvs/itsdangerous/lib/python3.6/site-packages/itsdangerous/jws.py\", line 143, in loads\r\n    self.make_signer(salt, self.algorithm).unsign(want_bytes(s)),\r\n  File \"/home/huss/.virtualenvs/itsdangerous/lib/python3.6/site-packages/itsdangerous/signer.py\", line 169, in unsign\r\n    raise BadSignature(\"Signature %r does not match\" % sig, payload=value)\r\nitsdangerous.exc.BadSignature: Signature b'nKcizI38sjEbao_XTh9VB2vMZPYwVpoEpAJboU7BqOL7VpR-zFPyWkBzaryxrOvUKP9J74MnNIBNSOCj4ERQDQ' does not match\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then tried the above again and explicitly set the `digest_method` and `algorithm_name` when initing the serializers. Like so:\r\n```python\r\nimport hashlib\r\nfrom itsdangerous import JSONWebSignatureSerializer\r\ns1 = JSONWebSignatureSerializer('a-key', salt='a-salt', signer_kwargs={'digest_method': hashlib.sha512}, algorithm_name='HS512')\r\n```\r\n...but got the same result as above.\r\n\r\nCould not think of what the issue could be after trying many different combinations of code and versions. It's almost as if the signer digest method is ignored in all cases when using the `JSONWebSignatureSerializer`. All of the other signers seemed fine when I tested them. I have forked the repo and added a couple of tests here https://github.com/HUSSTECH/itsdangerous/commit/74b9bbf6ee3a024fcf64138f7883f75493e98f2b. I made these tests to see if an intentional mismatch of the `digest_method` would raise an exception, but it did not, and everything passed through as valid.\r\n\r\nAre there any other (known) differences I'm missing between 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 specifically for `JSONWebSignatureSerializer` classes?", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/126", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/126/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/126/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/126/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/126", "id": 407514106, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0MDc1MTQxMDY=", "number": 126, "title": "TimedSerializer accepts timestamps from the future", "user": {"login": "dimaqq", "id": 662249, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjI0OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/662249?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq", "html_url": "https://github.com/dimaqq", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dimaqq/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1383812326, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzgzODEyMzI2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/labels/good-first-issue", "name": "good-first-issue", "color": "4bed64", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/milestones/2", "html_url": "https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/milestone/2", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/itsdangerous/milestones/2/labels", "id": 5308035, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTMwODAzNQ==", "number": 2, "title": "2.0.0", "description": "", "creator": {"login": "davidism", "id": 1242887, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI4ODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1242887?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 14, "state": "open", "created_at": "2020-04-14T15:31:06Z", "updated_at": "2020-05-13T00:11:50Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": null}, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2019-02-07T02:09:30Z", "updated_at": "2020-04-17T16:13:44Z", "closed_at": "2020-04-17T16:13:44Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "My team too was \"hit\" by https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/120 not having read the change log carefully enough.\r\n\r\nDigging deeper, a colleague discovered that while `(signs) 0.24 -> 1.1.0 (verifies)` path is broken / requires a work-around, the `1.1.0 -> 0.24` path still kinda works.\r\n\r\nIt works by the virtue of 1.1.0 sending much larger timestamps (numerically), which are interpreted as being far in the future by 0.24.

"Hi.\n\nI decided to use itsdangerous for signing in some application. The unittests' results were quite random (sometimes it passed, sometimes not).\nThe test checked malforming of a signature. I was lazy so I changed only last byte in signature. I was using itsdangerous==0.23.\n\nThe code did something like that:\n\n``` python\nsecret = '9ISi8M11WmwC6A=='\nvalid = 'z8ScUFn13crlUQ==.z08qK6VBPU8lSlnZON_xgFXlAEhpgJbG0H_MAWYSQkvUhhrIrDrDKCUrNqKh6ToY6XogaQD2UoTvRo2eHzZPLw'\ninvalid = 'z8ScUFn13crlUQ==.z08qK6VBPU8lSlnZON_xgFXlAEhpgJbG0H_MAWYSQkvUhhrIrDrDKCUrNqKh6ToY6XogaQD2UoTvRo2eHzZPLx'\n\nfrom itsdangerous import Signer\nfrom hashlib import sha512\n\ns = Signer(secret, digest_method=sha512)\n\ns.unsign(valid)\ns.unsign(invalid)\n```\n\nAbove code will execute correctly (at least on my machine, amd64, python2.7.5+, itsdangerous==0.23).\n\nFor a while of digging I think I found the source of the problem.\n\n```\nunsign -> verify_signature -> base64_decode -> base64.urlsafe_b64decode\n```\n\nA little example:\n\n``` ipython\nIn [11]: base64.urlsafe_b64decode('z08qK6VBPU8lSlnZON_xgFXlAEhpgJbG0H_MAWYSQkvUhhrIrDrDKCUrNqKh6ToY6XogaQD2UoTvRo2eHzZPLw==')\nOut[11]: '\\xcfO*+\\xa5A=O%JY\\xd98\\xdf\\xf1\\x80U\\xe5\\x00Hi\\x80\\x96\\xc6\\xd0\\x7f\\xcc\\x01f\\x12BK\\xd4\\x86\\x1a\\xc8\\xac:\\xc3(%+6\\xa2\\xa1\\xe9:\\x18\\xe9z i\\x00\\xf6R\\x84\\xefF\\x8d\\x9e\\x1f6O/'\n\nIn [12]: base64.urlsafe_b64decode('z08qK6VBPU8lSlnZON_xgFXlAEhpgJbG0H_MAWYSQkvUhhrIrDrDKCUrNqKh6ToY6XogaQD2UoTvRo2eHzZPLx==')\nOut[12]: '\\xcfO*+\\xa5A=O%JY\\xd98\\xdf\\xf1\\x80U\\xe5\\x00Hi\\x80\\x96\\xc6\\xd0\\x7f\\xcc\\x01f\\x12BK\\xd4\\x86\\x1a\\xc8\\xac:\\xc3(%+6\\xa2\\xa1\\xe9:\\x18\\xe9z i\\x00\\xf6R\\x84\\xefF\\x8d\\x9e\\x1f6O/'\n```\n\nMaybe some additional padding should be added?
