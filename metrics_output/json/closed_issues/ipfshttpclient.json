If the GNU FDL is used, a \"GNU Free Documentation License\" section is needed according to the license itself (see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html#addendum: \r\n\r\n> A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\".\r\n\r\n).\r\n\r\n3.

Then I've added:\r\n  ```\r\n  This section also lists all the copyright notes for third parties\r\n  components used in this project.\r\n\r\n  Copyright (C)  2019  Marco Bresciani.\r\n\r\n  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\r\n  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or\r\n  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no\r\n  Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A\r\n  copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free\r\n  Documentation License\".\r\n  ```\r\n  And then a subsection for each dependency, with a couple of lines stating the license and the official link (on dependency site), that reports the license itself. For example:\r\n  ```markdown\r\n  ### Official GPL Logo\r\n  These images are in the public domain. See\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/graphics/license-logos.html.en.\r\n  ```\r\n  And then I've added a subsection (of License section) called GNU Free Documentation License, \r\n  copying the whole markdown file of the GNU FDL.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/99", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/99/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/99/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/99/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/99", "id": 496346454, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0OTYzNDY0NTQ=", "number": 99, "title": "Chinese translation", "user": {"login": "notfresh", "id": 12556509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTU2NTA5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12556509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh", "html_url": "https://github.com/notfresh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notfresh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 274090621, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQwOTA2MjE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/labels/help%20wanted", "name": "help wanted", "color": "159818", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2019-09-20T13:15:02Z", "updated_at": "2019-11-14T17:10:49Z", "closed_at": "2019-11-14T17:10:48Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "How about this idea?

Although it\u2019s historically made for Node and npm projects, it also applies to libraries in other languages and package managers.\r\n\r\nMy goal, why i contribute here, is to have **one** ressource i can **recommend** to people that ask **how to write great readmes**. (right now i started an initiative to standardize the readmes of projects in my company)\r\n\r\nI think a spec will not be that ressource, but it is a strong foundation to build on. I would compare it to the CommonMark spec, that probably most people who use Markdown on GitHub (that is actually not even CommonMark but GFM based on CommonMark) havn't read.\r\n\r\nSome people might like a CLI generator programm, i would prefer an interactive website.\r\n\r\nSo i would like to define the goal wider, something like:\r\n\r\n>Provide a standardized readme template for open source projects.\r\n\r\nIt should be usable for most projects on github. For example:\r\n\r\n- desktop software with GUI, for example https://github.com/atom/atom\r\n- software with CLI, for example https://github.com/ansible/ansible\r\n- software libraries, for example https://github.com/requests/requests\r\n- websites, for example https://github.com/elementary/website\r\n- texts and documents, for example https://github.com/seriesseed/equity\r\n- datasets, for example https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist\r\n- fonts: https://github.com/theleagueof/league-spartan\r\n- 3D objects, for example https://github.com/sparkfun/3D_Models\r\n\r\nIt can be questioned if following a spec makes a better readme. https://www.makeareadme.com/ for example sais \"Every project is different, so consider which of these suggestions apply to yours.\". A spec and badge may implies that you SHOULD follow it and might degrade people or project that don't. Maybe promoting a guide and TEMPLATE would be better to reach our goal and have the spec only in background like CommonMark?\r\n\r\nWe also need to define the audience of a readme. I think that will be **users** and (potential) **contributors**.

Besides using human judgement, I don't think so.

I like that convention because it lets users know that this is a proper npm package -- not some janky old-style JS project where you download a \"standard.min.js\" file or something.\n> \n> I've heard folks argue that it's best to put \"Install\" later, after the user has learned what the package does and is actually ready to use it. But that makes it harder for users who already know what it's for does to find out the npm package name, and obscures the fact that it's a simple-to-install npm package. I think that ought to be right at the top.\n\nI think this is a very good point. Around one third of [the top 30 npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star) have install sections near the top. I like how [node-redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) does this: it just has 'Install with' at the top. \n\nI want to look into this more: the issue really isn't where Install is, it's where the ToC is. Someone else has raised questions about the Table of Contents to me, and whether it is necessary. We could collapse the ToC: \n### Actionable items\n- [ ] Talk about how to best do this here\n- [ ] Go through npm modules and find justification for having a Table of Contents where it is\n- [ ] Add an FAQ to the spec about where the Install section should go, and whether adding a non-header `npm install package` is OK.\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/24", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/24/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/24/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/24/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/24", "id": 168097869, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNjgwOTc4Njk=", "number": 24, "title": "Measure standard-readme's impact", "user": {"login": "daviddias", "id": 1211152, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTExNTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1211152?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias", "html_url": "https://github.com/daviddias", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daviddias/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 274090621, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQwOTA2MjE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/labels/help%20wanted", "name": "help wanted", "color": "159818", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2016-07-28T13:39:26Z", "updated_at": "2019-11-14T16:57:37Z", "closed_at": "2019-11-14T16:57:37Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "It would be amazing to have a way to infer the impact of adopting standard-readme, to make sure that it not only improves the quality of a project, and therefore more usage, but also opens the floor for innovation (A/B testing).

For shorter ones, I don't think it adds too much noise, and it is still useful for simply not having to think about scrolling. A lot of people work on GitHub on small screens - my mac is a puny 5 inches high. Having a ToC helps more than it detracts. Keeping it to second-level headers only is useful.

The README should be the sole source of information - it can link elsewhere (like to the LICENSE file), and I think this redundancy (which you are right, it is) is useful, in that regard. If I just `cat` the README, I should know the License without having to look in another file. Also, package.json is js-specific. I want standard-readme to be more than just javascript. \n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/13", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/13/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/13/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/13/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/13", "id": 156223318, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNTYyMjMzMTg=", "number": 13, "title": "Add reasoning to each section", "user": {"login": "RichardLitt", "id": 910753, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDc1Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/910753?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt", "html_url": "https://github.com/RichardLitt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RichardLitt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 274090623, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQwOTA2MjM=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/RichardLitt/standard-readme/labels/question", "name": "question", "color": "cc317c", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2016-05-23T08:15:55Z", "updated_at": "2016-05-26T14:37:42Z", "closed_at": "2016-05-26T14:37:42Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I wonder if it would be good to add, directly in the spec, reasoning for each section.

This makes it easy for readers to \"short circuit\" and continue the hunt for the right module elsewhere without wasting time delving into unnecessary details.\n\nI think standard-readme would only need a couple of tweaks, though these are of course all personal preferences that are biased toward small modules (in any ecosystem):\n1. Consider making the TOC optional, only because it introduces a **lot** of visual interference for people scanning the readme. It can _easily_ add an extra pageful or two if all children sections are present. If a user does opt in for one, consider maybe only showing top-level items.\n2. Consider pushing **Installation** under **API**. This is on the premise that a user is unlikely to consider installing a program unless they've looked at it in some detail, which generally includes a perusal of its usage and its API.\n\nCool!
