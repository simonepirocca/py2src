Since this server side component is only meant for testing purposes, it will not integrate with Active Directory or Domain Controller, but will simply authenticate using a hard-coded list of credentials. However, it will support all types of NTLM authentication - LM, NTLM, LMv2, NTLMv2, NTLM2 Session Response, NTLM1 Signing & Sealing, etc. This will provide a way to test the NTLM capabilities of the clients. It will be an NTLM equivalent to http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd which can be used to test basic authentication.\r\n\r\nMy question is - does this library have - (1) support to compute Type 2 (Challenge) messages by taking a Type 1 message as input and (2) support to compute the authentication result message by taking a Type 3 message? Or is this only a client-side library that will help in generating Type 1 and Type 3 messages?\r\n\r\nI took a look at the code and I think this library only helps to compute Type 1 and Type 3 messages. But can you please confirm? (I am new to Python and I might have missed something.)", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}]}
