Please comment on them in this issue here.\n1. We could move the content of `ld/constants.py` into `ld/__init__.py`. The externally visible part of the `ld.constants` sub-module defines three translation tables for the normalization of distro IDs. That somehow seems too small to warrant its own sub-module.\n2. Naming inconsistency of the `get_*_release_attr()` functions. They are the only ones with a `get_` prefix. The `*_release_info()` functions, as well as the functions to retrieve the single information items such as `name()` do not have such a prefix. We could remove the `get_` prefix from the `get_*_release_attr()` functions and methods.\n3. Version returned in `info()`: Its result currently includes the first version found. We could change it to include the best version found, instead (see `best` parameter of `version()`).\n\nMore??\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/70", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/70/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/70/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/70/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nir0s/distro/issues/70", "id": 140481102, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNDA0ODExMDI=", "number": 70, "title": "Add testcase for Fedora 19 (has non-ASCII characters in codename)", "user": {"login": "andy-maier", "id": 8939758, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzk3NTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8939758?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier", "html_url": "https://github.com/andy-maier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 342363544, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzNDIzNjM1NDQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/labels/area:%20test", "name": "area: test", "color": "207de5", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 293330271, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyOTMzMzAyNzE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/labels/help%20wanted", "name": "help wanted", "color": "159818", "default": true, "description": null}, {"id": 342364170, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzNDIzNjQxNzA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/labels/resolution:%20fixed", "name": "resolution: fixed", "color": "cccccc", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "andy-maier", "id": 8939758, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzk3NTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8939758?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier", "html_url": "https://github.com/andy-maier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "andy-maier", "id": 8939758, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzk3NTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8939758?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier", "html_url": "https://github.com/andy-maier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2016-03-13T12:27:31Z", "updated_at": "2016-03-16T23:44:41Z", "closed_at": "2016-03-16T23:44:41Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Fedora 19 is an interesting testcase because it is one of the few distros with non-ASCII characters in its codename \"Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019sCat\".

Ideally, this should be done such that the parsing is performed only once.\n\nThis approach leaves the possibility to add support for parsing `*version` files with their specific format in the future.

For example, does it denote:\n   a) where the source code comes from (RHEL comes from Fedora, CentOS comes from RHEL, Oracle comes from xxx)?\n   b) some sort of family (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Oracle would all be the same family)?\n   c) something similar to like()? Note that the implementation of base() uses the result of like() for distros that are not in DIST_TO_BASE, but like() is using the LIKE attribute in /etc/os-release which sometimes contains more than one distro ID. If we stick with using like() as the default, then the description of base() should mention that it may end up returning more than one string.\n\nComments / Opinions?\n", "performed_via_github_app":

Not every distro supports all Python versions listed in tox.ini. For example, CentOS 7 does not support Python 2.6 anymore, and there is also no community package for Python 2.6 that I'm aware of. A missing Python environment causes Tox to return a return code !=0 (failure). This can be addressed by adding the skip_missing_interpreters variable to the [tox] section of tox.ini. Tox then issues a SKIPPED message for any missing environments but returns a return code of 0.\n   \n   Because this variable requires at least tox 1.7.2, the version installed by the Makefile should be changed from ==1.7.1\" to \">=1.7.2\". Because of the \">\" sign, quotes are needed around that. I verified that Tox version 2.x one gets with that requirement works fine on all distros I tested with. It would also be good to check the minimum version in the tox.ini file itself, for those people that run Tox directly without Make.\n   \n   Another issue I found in the Makefile is that in its \"test\" target, it installs Tox into the current Python environment. Tox needs to be installed into the system python, which requires root rights. So a \"sudo\" should be added, there.\n   \n   I believe this is the only place where \"sudo\" should be added to Makefile commands, but it would be good to verify that. For example, the \"instdev\" target is probably meant to install the dependencies into the current Python (e.g. a manually created virtual environment), so that is fine without \"sudo\".\n   \n   The following changes address all of these issues:\n   - Add these two lines to the [tox] section of tox.ini:\n     \n     ```\n     [tox]\n     minversion = 1.7.2\n     skip_missing_interpreters = true\n     ```\n   - Change the test target in Makefile to become:\n     \n     ```\n     test:\n           sudo pip install 'tox>=1.7.2'\n           tox\n     ```\n2. On some distros, Python 3.5 has not arrived yet. For example, on Fedora 22, it will likely never arrive, because the next Fedora version will get it but Fedora 22 will stay on Python 3.4. So I think it makes sense to add Python 3.4 to the list of environments in tox.ini.\n3. I found that on some distros, Tox does not automatically infer the right Python command for the standard environments (py<NN>). I was able to get that running on all distros that I'm testing on, by adding specific [testenv:py<NN>] sections for all Python versions:\n   \n   ```\n   [testenv:py26]\n   basepython = python2.6\n   \n   [testenv:py27]\n   basepython = python2.7\n   \n   [testenv:py34]\n   basepython = python3.4\n   \n   [testenv:py35]\n   basepython = python3.5\n   ```\n4. The Makefile specifies in its \"instdev\" target the -r option for pip without a space between the option and the filename: \"-rdev-requirements.txt\". While for some strange reason, the space does not seem to be allowed in the deps variable of tox.ini, the pip help indicates there is a space between the option and the filename. It seems that pip can deal with a command line that omits the space, but in theory it could change that anytime based upon what its help text states, and that may even happen by accident if the change is in some option parser.\n   \n   So while this is not an immediate issue, I still suggest to add the space in the Makefile:\n   \n   ```\n   instdev:\n           pip install -r dev-requirements.txt\n           python setup.py develop\n   ```\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/13", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/13/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/13/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/13/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nir0s/distro/issues/13", "id": 123466667, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMjM0NjY2Njc=", "number": 13, "title": "Test results 12/22", "user": {"login": "andy-maier", "id": 8939758, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzk3NTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8939758?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier", "html_url": "https://github.com/andy-maier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2015-12-22T11:44:01Z", "updated_at": "2016-01-10T19:15:33Z", "closed_at": "2016-01-10T19:15:33Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hi, this is not an issue.\nAttached is a file with the test results on some distros:\n[testresults.txt](https://github.com/nir0s/ld/files/69594/testresults.txt)\n\nSome things to note (some of which may in fact be issues):\n- On Arch Linux, there is no version defined. This is probably a result of their philosophy not to have a version, but instead to always ensure everything is at the latest level. It would still be nice to be able to say at what level the system was at a particular point.\n- On CentOS 6.7, the ld parsing results in an empty version and codename, even though there are distro release files that define that, and it is able to figure out that the distro name is \"centos\". Strangely enough, the distro_release_info() is entirely empty, which it should not be given that info() finds out the name. I did not investigate this further.\n- On Debian 8.2, the version is \"8\", because the VERSION field in the os-release file says so. However, the lsb_release command returns \"8.2\" for the version. there is no /etc/lsb-release file, but an /etc/debian-version file with the line \"8.2\" in it. This might be a good reason to special-case the distro in order to find the more detailed version.\n- On Ubuntu 14.04, the release files specify only \"14.04\" as a version in the version fields, but specify \"14.04.3\" in the pretty name in both the os-release and lsb-release files. It would be nice to special-case that too to determine the more detailed version.\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/12", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/12/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/12/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/nir0s/distro/issues/12/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/nir0s/distro/issues/12", "id": 123228222, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMjMyMjgyMjI=", "number": 12, "title": "Docstrings missing for *_info()", "user": {"login": "andy-maier", "id": 8939758, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzk3NTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8939758?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier", "html_url": "https://github.com/andy-maier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2015-12-21T08:03:48Z", "updated_at": "2015-12-24T11:09:50Z", "closed_at": "2015-12-24T11:09:50Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The functions os_release_info(), lsb_release_info(), and distro_release_info() are public but do not have a docstring currently.\n\nFor distro_release_info(), the returned dictionary can be described, because the ld code generates it.\n\nFor os_release_info(), I suggest to point to http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html for a definition of the fields, and to mention that the field names are converted to lower case.\n\nFor lsb_release_info(), the information items returned by the lsb_release command have not changed between LSB 1.0 and LSB 5.0, so I think it is safe to describe them explicitly.

Anything after the so defined version is dropped. E.g. suffixes with letters (e.g. \"rc\", \"dev\", \"a\") are dropped, or the hyphen.\n- The regexp does not allow for digits in the codename.
