There have been several commits since then, and a new version needs to be released to apply the changes to PyPI. I personally have been affected by the issue fixed in ee956229c22eb4b4ae893301cefcdb25e7eccaf2 when trying to use `pandas` functions that depend on `apiclient`. There are also two good PRs waiting to be merged - the addition of tests and `tox` would be nice, even if development isn't moving very quickly :grinning: \n\nSo, even if you don't merge the new PRs, could you release 1.0.3? I'm currently `pip` installing via github, which I'd rather not do in the long run. All it would take would be to update `setup.py` with the new version, `CHANGES.rst` with a note or two on the new release and its date, draft a release on Github, and push to PyPI. \n\nThanks!\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/9", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/9/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/9/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/9/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/shazow/apiclient/issues/9", "id": 101736073, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMDE3MzYwNzM=", "number": 9, "title": "Add python3 support", "user": {"login": "Daenyth", "id": 14644, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjQ0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14644?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Daenyth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Daenyth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 11, "created_at": "2015-08-18T19:54:56Z", "updated_at": "2015-08-18T20:06:23Z", "closed_at": "2015-08-18T20:06:23Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hopefully it's as easy as running 2to3\n\n```\n  File \"foo.py\", line 6, in <module>\n    from apiclient.discovery import build as google_service_build\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/environment3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/apiclient/__init__.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from .base import APIClient, APIClient_SharedSecret\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/environment3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/apiclient/base.py\", line 4, in <module>\n    from urllib import urlencode\nImportError: cannot import name 'urlencode'\n```\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/6", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/6/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/6/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/shazow/apiclient/issues/6/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/shazow/apiclient/issues/6", "id": 70500312, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU3MDUwMDMxMg==", "number": 6, "title": "apiclient isn't verifying HTTPS by default", "user": {"login": "franciscod", "id": 726447, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjQ0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/726447?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod", "html_url": "https://github.com/franciscod", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2015-04-23T20:04:01Z", "updated_at": "2019-03-13T15:18:49Z", "closed_at": "2019-03-13T15:18:49Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Trying to access any https endpoint leads to an exception.
