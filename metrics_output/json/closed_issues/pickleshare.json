Python 2 backport\r\n    from pathlib2 import Path\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to note that \u2014 besides the stdlib [pathlib module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) that is present since Python 3.4, there are two backports out there: [pathlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathlib) and [pathlib2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathlib2).\r\n\r\nThe pathlib backport aims to backport the basic pathlib module (from Python 3.4, I think) to older versions of Python in a forward-compatible way. Since it uses the same name as the standard module, it is impossible to use it in Python 3.4+ (the standard module shadows it).\r\n\r\nThe pathlib2 package is a rolling backport of pathlib from the newest version of Python. It uses a different module name, so that it can be used in newer versions of Python as well (possibly providing newer functions that the pathlib module from the particular version of Python).\r\n\r\nThat considered, I see two possibilities:\r\n1. you need pathlib with Python 3.4 API \u2014 in which case you just `inherit pathlib` unconditionally, and add a dependency on `pathlib` package in Python < 3.4;\r\n2. you need pathlib with newer API \u2014 in which case you need to `inherit pathlib2` also in some newer versions of Python, and add appropriate dependency on `pathlib2`.\r\n\r\nI think pickleshare falls into the first category. In which case the current code is incorrect since when `pathlib` is installed, then `pathlib2` is never used and the dependency is unnecessary.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0},
