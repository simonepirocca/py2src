precisely is and if I can rely on it in the end. \r\n\r\n**What I'm trying to do** \r\nI have a DB collection with both products and brands stored. They don't have the same model, therefore I implemented 2 different schemas for them.\r\nNow in another schema, I want to serialize a list of such items (products or brands). \r\n\r\n**How I do it**\r\nUsing polyfield and marshmallow, it looks like:\r\n```\r\nclass BrandSchema(Schema):\r\n    name = fields.String()\r\n    organization_name = fields.String()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ProductSchema(Schema):\r\n    name = fields.String()\r\n    brand = fields.Nested(BrandSchema())\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ProductOrBrandGroupSchema(Schema):\r\n    name = fields.String()\r\n    items = fields.List(Polyfield(\r\n        serialization_schema_selector=...,\r\n        deserialization_schema_selector=...,\r\n        required=True,\r\n    ))\r\n```\r\nThis works fine.\r\nOne thing to note, in the situation where `items` are only products, we would use a nested field:\r\n`items = fields.List(fields.Nested(fields.Product( ....`\r\n\r\n**The problem**\r\nNow I have another schema that nests this last one:\r\n```\r\nclass MySchema(Schema):\r\n    group = fields.Nested(ProductOrBrandGroupSchema())\r\n    name = fields.String()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to exclude `items` when serializing `MySchema`. Say I have an instance `my_schema`, I use:\r\n```\r\nMySchema(exclude=['group.items']).dump(my_schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return the serialization **but will not exlude `items`** : hence, `exclude` with dot notation is for nested schemas.\r\n\r\n**The question**\r\n`Polyfield` looks like a field, however its two selector methods returns schemas. If it were a schema, I could write `fields.List(fields.Nested(Polyfield(...` but this does not work.\r\n\r\nDo you see a way of doing this? Have you seen an implementation of `Polyschema`? Is this what `Polyfield` should actually be?\r\n\r\nI hope this is clear enough.

My suggestion is to create a new release branch here for updating marshmallow-3.X and then I can pull my changes here. I would be willing also to make sure these changes are compatible with HEAD of master but as I said my particular use case is only for `marshmallow~=2.0`. I have left the pull request open on my fork in case there is any changes any one would like to request.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/macbeth322/marshmallow-polyfield/pull/1", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/issues/9", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/issues/9/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/issues/9/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/issues/9/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/issues/9", "id": 264035890, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyNjQwMzU4OTA=", "number": 9, "title": "python2 pip install of latest release (w/ explicit ==3.2 specifier) fails", "user": {"login": "pjenvey", "id": 14639, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjM5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14639?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey", "html_url": "https://github.com/pjenvey", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pjenvey/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2017-10-09T21:45:31Z", "updated_at": "2017-11-15T03:09:01Z", "closed_at": "2017-11-15T03:09:01Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "```\r\n$ python --version\r\nPython 2.7.13\r\n$ pip --version\r\npip 9.0.1 from /tmp/marsp/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)\r\n$ pip install marshmallow-polyfield==3.2\r\nCollecting marshmallow-polyfield==3.2\r\n  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement marshmallow-polyfield==3.2 (from versions: 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1)\r\nNo matching distribution found for marshmallow-polyfield==3.2\r\n$ pip install --no-cache marshmallow-polyfield\r\nCollecting marshmallow-polyfield\r\n  Downloading marshmallow-polyfield-3.1.tar.gz\r\nRequirement already satisfied: marshmallow>=2.0.0 in ./lib/python2.7/site-packages (from marshmallow-polyfield)\r\nInstalling collected packages: marshmallow-polyfield\r\n  Running setup.py install for marshmallow-polyfield ... done\r\nSuccessfully installed marshmallow-polyfield-3.1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nVery likely due to only a py3-none-any.whl existing on pypi.
