I'd like to be able to configure bumpversion to bump this to \"v4\" when the next major version is created.\r\nIt looks like I could maybe use a combination of the \"parse\" and \"search\" directives within a `[bumpversion:file:...]` section in my cfg file.

In our case, setup.py is one of those files (normal stuff) and our install_requires can regularly list exact versions of other apps (abnormal but supported). Bumpversion likes to Loki it up in there. \r\n\r\nLet's say my setup.cfg looks like this, a real basic one:\r\n```bash\r\n>> cat setup.cfg \r\n[bumpversion]\r\ncurrent_version = 1.0.2\r\ncommit = False\r\ntag = False\r\ntag_name = {new_version}\r\n\r\n[bumpversion:file:setup.py]\r\n\r\n[bumpversion:file:myapp/__init__.py]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd my setup.py looks like this:\r\n```python\r\nfrom setuptools import setup\r\n__version__ = '1.0.2'\r\n\r\nsetup(\r\n    name='myapp',\r\n    version=__version__,\r\n    install_requires=[\r\n        'Flask==1.0.2'\r\n    ]\r\n    ...other useful irrelevant stuff....\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run bumpversion on this project, it bumps the Flask version as well since it's the same \"version\", and causes our CICD to burst into flames.\r\n\r\nWhat would it take to get a config/cli option for \"keyword\"? Like in setup.cfg, we can say what pattern our version follows, so it would be equally awesome to list a keyword that will always be found on the lines with the version, such as \"version\", so bumpversion only replaces versions found on lines that contain the keyword.

interpolation behavior of config files by `bumpversion` and `setuptools` is not the same. `bumpversion` uses no interpolation (e.g. [`configparser.RawConfigParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.RawConfigParser)), but `setuptools` uses the default interpolation of [`configparser.ConfigParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser), which is \"basic interpolation\".\r\n\r\nIn general, this should not be an issue, but because `bumpversion` supports setting configuration in the `setup.cfg` file, options that might be interpolated by the parser would not cause an issue if they appear in the `.bumpversion.cfg`, but suddenly break the install/build process if they are moved to the `setup.cfg`.\r\n\r\nFor example, I had the following in my `.bumpversion.cfg` to automatically insert the date in my CHANGELOG along with the version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[bumpversion:file:docs/source/changelog.rst]\r\nsearch = XX-XX-XXXX v. X.X.X\r\nreplace = {now:%m-%d-%Y} v. {new_version}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I moved this into my `setup.cfg`, `bumpversion` still works but the following happens when I try to run anything with `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n ...\r\nconfigparser.InterpolationSyntaxError: '%' must be followed by '%' or '(', found: '%m-%d-%Y} v. {new_version}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution of escaping the `%` so that they are not interpolated (e.g. `{now:%%m-%%d-%%Y}` causes `setuptools` to not fail, but then `bumpversion` inserts the literal string \"`%%m-%%d-%%Y`\" instead of formatting the date because the percent signs are not treated as needing escaping.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that other packages have run into this, like `pytest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3062. [This `distutils` mailing thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-July/031091.html) also illustrates that the python devs are struggling with if this was a good design decision, but that's a whole other can of worms.\r\n\r\n**My proposal**: When loading from `setup.cfg`, use `configparser.ConfigParser`, and when loading from `.bumpversion.cfg`, use `configparser.RawConfigParser`.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/c4urself/bump2version/issues/17", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/c4urself/bump2version", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/c4urself/bump2version/issues/17/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/c4urself/bump2version/issues/17/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/c4urself/bump2version/issues/17/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version/issues/17", "id": 319665970, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMTk2NjU5NzA=", "number": 17, "title": "README on pypi.org not readable", "user": {"login": "vlcinsky", "id": 635911, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTkxMQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/635911?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky", "html_url": "https://github.com/vlcinsky", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vlcinsky/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 14, "created_at": "2018-05-02T18:37:20Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-31T09:18:54Z", "closed_at": "2018-08-24T14:30:50Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/ shows content of README, which is broken.\r\n\r\nthere seem to be two reasons:\r\n- the value for `long_description` is provided as bytes and not as a string\r\n- the content if formatted as markdown and not reStructuredText\r\n\r\nWith refactored https://pypi.org well readable README can serve as great presentation of the package and `bump2version` can definitely do better.\r\n\r\nIf reStructuredText seems too difficult, I volunteer to write it properly.
