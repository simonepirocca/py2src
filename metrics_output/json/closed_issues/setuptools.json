Specifically, under what circumstances would `python setup.py sdist` skip over python files?\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\nI have a script that we use to package all our python code intended to be used for AWS Lambda and publishes it to s3. We run it from a container in CI that is sourced from a SHA (meaning it is the **exact same container image** every time). When i run the container locally to test the build / publication it works fine. However, when I run it from github actions, it mysteriously skips over **only** the python package we're trying to publish.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this code isn't public so I cannot share but...

Pip has the `--no-build-isolation` option, with which the caller can declare that they have taken care of build dependencies and pip should try to build the package in the current environment. This is useful for downstream packagers, and for experimenting with different versions of your build dependencies. But setuptools doesn't know about this, so it charges ahead and attempts to install things when that's not what you want.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm looking at is to only specify `setup_requires` if `'egg_info' in sys.argv`, as is the case when the `get_requires_for_build_*` hooks are called.

"2020-08-10T14:52:41Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I first expressed concerns about the fact that `distutils` needs to be imported *after* `setuptools` in [this post](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/2143#issuecomment-637586551), and I did not realize that we had not adequately addressed this before the `distutils` adoption. I think we should re-consider the way this is done, to avoid any sort of requirement on the sort order.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you `import setuptools`, [`distutils` is injected into `sys.modules`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/37d81f4ce8f08c4baf44b6ff0f3f1bd3f6b2a127/setuptools/distutils_patch.py#L48-L61).\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that it requires importing `setuptools` before `distutils`, which most people will *not* be doing right now (by almost all common import sort orders, `distutils` comes first).\r\n\r\n@jaraco [explains why it's done this way here](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2230#issuecomment-657327796):\r\n\r\n> I did consider another approach, where Setuptools could add a .pth file that would import setuptools.distutils_patch. Such an approach would always happen earlier and so would not be subject to the race that's happening here, but it would also happen whether or not setuptools was imported (on any invocation of Python in that environment).\r\n\r\nI think one preferred solution would be for us to install a `distutils` package that would be imported before `distutils`. The problem is that in the standard `sys.path`, `site-packages` comes *after* the standard library. Since anything we do here will be a tremendous hack, I'm thinking that maybe the most surgical way to accomplish this is to do something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Create a `setuptools._distutils/import_hack/distutils/__init__.py` (where there's no `__init__.py` in `import_hack`) that invokes `import setuptools.distutils_patch`.\r\n2. Add a `.pth` file that injects `$SITEPACKAGES/setuptools/_import_hack/` into `sys.path` *before* the standard library.\r\n\r\nAnother option I think we should consider is stepping up the timetable on providing everything `distutils` provides directly from the `setuptools` namespace, [as I described here](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/2143#issuecomment-637586551):\r\n\r\n> I personally would prefer it if we made the setuptools namespace the canonical namespace, and have distutils just import symbols from setuptools and possibly wrap them in deprecation warnings.\r\n\r\nRight now, there are things that you *must* import from `distutils`, and so we can't say, \"You can avoid an issue with the sort order by just not importing `distutils`\". If we provide everything that `distutils` provides in the `setuptools` namespace, we can just say, \"Just use the `setuptools` version and you won't have this problem.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think we should do a combination of both \u2014 make it so importing `distutils` still works in whatever order you do it in *and* move everything to the canonical `setuptools` namespace. That will make it easier to actively deprecate direct use of `distutils`, and pave the way for us eventually removing the need for the `.pth` file (though the fastest road to not having the `.pth` file will be via removing `distutils` from the standard library).", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2257", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2257/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2257/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2257/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2257", "id": 655479900, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NTU0Nzk5MDA=", "number": 2257, "title": "Compilation issues when SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS is local", "user": {"login": "matham", "id": 1644286, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQyODY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1644286?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham", "html_url": "https://github.com/matham", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matham/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2020-07-12T21:27:35Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-02T13:58:42Z", "closed_at": "2020-08-02T13:48:14Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "After https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2212 I tried setting `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS` to local, but ran into issues compiling.\r\n\r\n[Setuptools version](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/runs/863282728?check_suite_focus=true) is `49.2.0`.

I tried to build a toy C extension just to make sure everything worked, which has very simple code as follows.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"Python.h\"\r\n\r\n// short module description\r\n#define SHORT_MOD_DESC \"A test module to play with some Python stuff.\"\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Returns \"hello\" when called.\r\n */\r\nstatic PyObject* hello(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {\r\n    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, \"\")) {\r\n        Py_INCREF(Py_None);\r\n        return Py_None;\r\n    }\r\n    return PyUnicode_FromString(\"hello\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n// module functions\r\nPyMethodDef module_methods[] = {\r\n    {\"hello\",  hello, METH_VARARGS, \"Returns hello.\"},\r\n    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}\r\n};\r\n\r\n// define module\r\nstruct PyModuleDef my_test_def = {\r\n    PyModuleDef_HEAD_INIT,\r\n    \"my_test\", // name of module\r\n    SHORT_MOD_DESC, // module docstring\r\n    -1, // module state (-1 does not support subinterpreters)\r\n    module_methods\r\n};\r\n\r\n// initialize module\r\nPyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_my_test(void) {\r\n    return PyModule_Create(&my_test_def);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI used a standard `setup.py` file to install, i.e.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\r\n\r\nmy_test = Extension(\"my_test\", sources = [\"my_test.c\"])\r\n\r\ndef _setup():\r\n    setup(name = \"my_test\",\r\n          author = \"phetdam\",\r\n          description = \"Another attempt at building a C extension module\",\r\n          version = \"0.0.1\",\r\n          ext_modules = [my_test])\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    _setup()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the problem. Since I didn't want to use `virtualenv` or install globally, I had installed my Python packages locally, i.e. in `~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages`. Since `setuptools` is supposed to (at least according to `python3 setup.py install --help`) install in `~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages` if I give `install` the `--user` flag, that's what I did. To my surprise, I got\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously `setuptools` is trying to write somewhere it's not supposed to, but I (stupidly) decided to tried again by prepending `sudo` to the call, and then watched `setuptools` install the package directory to `/root/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages`, having **created** a new directory to do so. This behavior is nonsensical, and it's also not any of the directories listed in `sys.path`. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I changed `setuptools` to `distutils.core` in my `setup.py` as shown above, voila: my dumb package installed in `~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/my_test-0.0.1.egg-info`, exactly what I wanted. Then in the Python interpreter, I was able to `from my_test import hello` and call `hello()` just fine.\r\n\r\nThe `setuptools` I'm using is 45.2.0, and it's the system-wide `setuptools`, as `pip3 show setuptools` gives \r\n\r\n```\r\nName: setuptools\r\nVersion: 45.2.0\r\nSummary: Easily download, build, install, upgrade, and uninstall Python packages\r\nHome-page: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools\r\nAuthor: Python Packaging Authority\r\nAuthor-email: distutils-sig@python.org\r\nLicense: UNKNOWN\r\nLocation: /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\r\nRequires:\r\nRequired-by: Sphinx, ipython, launchpadlib\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe this issue has been fixed in later versions of `setuptools`? Either way, I can't really upgrade `setuptools` using `apt` since 45.2.0 is the latest version available on Ubuntu. Is this a bug in `setuptools`, am I just being dumb, or should I just stick with `distutils`? I don't really want to use with `distutils` since it's no longer recommended for packaging, but it looks like I might not have a choice in this case.

I searched about it in the docs but couldn't find an answer to this.\r\n\r\nI have a simple `setup.py` file containing my dependencies in `install_requires`. Let's say my package has 2 different dependencies: A and B. This means that, in my package, I use some code from A and I use some code from B. I don't put any specific versions for those 2 requirements inside `install_requires`, I only put their name. Now, let's say B actually also depends on A but up to a certain version, so in their own `setup.py` and \u00ecnstall_requires`, they will have something like: `A<2.24.0`. This works fine as long as A actually has no such version or above, but as soon as A releases the version 2.24.0 (and B doesn't/cannot update its `setup.py`), then when installing our package using pip, we will use a version that is not allowed by B (thus B is broken). When installing with pip, we will actually see a warning like this one:\r\n\r\n`B has requirement A<2.24.0, but you'll have A 2.24.0 which is incompatible.`\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this was normal that `setuptools` wouldn't find the highest version of A allowed by the other dependencies (i.e. B), instead of directly installing the latest version of A? If yes, then what is the standard way of preventing this kind of problem?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the help, this would be very appreciated.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2216", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2216/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2216/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2216/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2216", "id": 645142895, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NDUxNDI4OTU=", "number": 2216, "title": "Incompatible install in (summarize your environment)", "user": {"login": "whitedevil723", "id": 67404861, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDA0ODYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/67404861?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723", "html_url": "https://github.com/whitedevil723", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/whitedevil723/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1934018076, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM0MDE4MDc2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/labels/Python%202", "name": "Python 2", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-06-25T04:35:32Z", "updated_at": "2020-06-25T04:36:45Z", "closed_at": "2020-06-25T04:36:45Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nPlease DO NOT SUBMIT this template without first investigating the issue and answering the questions below.

Here's an example of a good run https://github.com/kivy/kivy/runs/791883878?check_suite_focus=true, and a bad run https://github.com/kivy/kivy/runs/791983410?check_suite_focus=true.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that this a GitHub Action environment issue, so I opened a bug report there: https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/1087. However, after some investigation, it seemed this is more likely a bug in setuptools. The reason is that using process monitor to check all instantiations of `link.exe` we looked at the environmental `PATH` variable of the process when it started. And in the failing examples, python would call `link.exe` multiple times for each cython generated c-file, but some of these would be missing all the visual studio compiler paths from its `PATH`.\r\n\r\nE.g. process monitor shows this during the compile step: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47745270/85335019-f7228800-b4e4-11ea-9010-a265c1849cc9.png).\r\n\r\nBut the first one's (6396) PATH is:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\\\Extensions\\Microsoft\\IntelliCode\\CLI\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.26.28801\\bin\\HostX86\\x64\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.26.28801\\bin\\HostX86\\x86\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\VC\\VCPackages\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\TestWindow\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\TeamFoundation\\Team Explorer\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\bin\\Roslyn\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Team Tools\\Performance Tools\\x64\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Team Tools\\Performance Tools\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Shared\\Common\\VSPerfCollectionTools\\vs2019\\\\x64\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Shared\\Common\\VSPerfCollectionTools\\vs2019\\\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v10.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.8 Tools\\\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\HTML Help Workshop\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\FSharp\\\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.19041.0\\x86\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\x86\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\r\nC:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\Common7\\Tools\\\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.8.3\\x64\\share\\sdl2\\bin\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.8.3\\x64\\share\\glew\\bin\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.8.3\\x64\\share\\gstreamer\\bin\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the second one's (6520) is much shorter and is missing 18 paths (Doesn't contain C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.19041.0\\x86 with rc.exe):\r\n```\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.8.3\\x64\\share\\sdl2\\bin\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.8.3\\x64\\share\\glew\\bin\r\nC:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.8.3\\x64\\share\\gstreamer\\bin\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can inspect a pared down process monitor log here (you need to open it in process monitor):\r\n[logfile.zip](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/files/4821977/logfile.zip) or get the full 100+MB file from this action: https://github.com/kivy/kivy/actions/runs/145338811. `procmon-3.8-x64` is the good log, `procmon-3.7-x64` is the bad log.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware, the only path type stuff we manipulate is with the following when some package is imported. But I fail to see how this could cause it:\r\n```py\r\n_root = sys.prefix\r\ndep_bins = [join(_root, 'share', 'sdl2', 'bin')]\r\nif isdir(dep_bins[0]):\r\n    os.environ[\"PATH\"] = dep_bins[0] + os.pathsep + os.environ[\"PATH\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe question is, why randomly within one `python -m pip install -e .` command does some `link.exe` get created without the proper visual studio paths in its environment? It seems like it must be some kind of race condition where in some cases, the compiler gets called with the wrong env?", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2211", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2211/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2211/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/issues/2211/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2211", "id": 643778591, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU2NDM3Nzg1OTE=", "number": 2211, "title": "Incompatible install in (summarize your environment)", "user": {"login": "Doulat31", "id": 65845014, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ1MDE0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/65845014?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31", "html_url": "https://github.com/Doulat31", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Doulat31/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1934018076, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM0MDE4MDc2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/setuptools/labels/Python%202", "name": "Python 2", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2020-06-23T11:57:19Z", "updated_at": "2020-06-23T13:37:41Z", "closed_at": "2020-06-23T13:37:41Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nPlease DO NOT SUBMIT this template without first investigating the issue and answering the questions below.
