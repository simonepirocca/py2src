Unfortunately, this commit also breaks usage with pipenv, as we can no longer specify an exact version pin in our Pipfile.\r\n\r\nIt seems that pipenv simply takes the union of all version strings specified by the Pipfile and its dependency chain and applies logic to that union. Therefore, if I specify the version to be EXACTLY `black==19.10b0`, I end up with a union which is `black==19.10b0,>19.3b0`. Logically, this resolves to `19.10b0`, but this is not what pipenv sees. Because black is still pre-release, pipenv must have a single version pin (or multiple of the same statement) that resolves to a single version. `black==19.10b0` would work, `black==19.10b0,black==19.10b0` would work, but (as mentioned) `black==19.10b0,>=19.3b0` does not.

Other black settings were not considered, and would be defaults (target python version, quotes, etc). Using max-line-length 88 was recommended in the flake8 configuration for using the plugin.\r\n\r\nThe new plan is to decouple the flake8 max-line-length setting for (``E501`` validation) from how black is involved. This means if flake8 and black both use 88 (or 120), and black has been run recently, you would get no ``BLK100`` errors and few if any ``E501`` errors.\r\n\r\nIs say few, because having used black from some months, it does fail to break long strings - in particular I see this with longer debugging messages, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef some_function(some_args):\r\n    \"\"\"\"Just an example.\"\"\"\r\n    # some code\r\n    sys.stderr.write(\"A very long string as a single variable in Python does not get broken by black, even if it exceeds the desired line length which could be %i or whatever\" % 88)\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter black becomes:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef some_function(some_args):\r\n    \"\"\"\"Just an example.\"\"\"\r\n    # some code\r\n    sys.stderr.write(\r\n        \"A very long string as a single variable in Python does not get broken by black, even if it exceeds the desired line length which could be %i or whatever\"\r\n        % 88\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, it is actually sometimes useful to set the flake8 max-line-length to be greater than the black line-length, if you have a lot of cases like this.\r\n\r\nUnder this new design, it would be nice but not essential to have a warning if the flake8 max-line-length is less than the black line-length.\r\n\r\nThe plugin documentation would continue to recommend setting the flake8 max-line-length to the black line-length, and suggest sticking with black's default of 88.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/peterjc/flake8-black/issues/3",
