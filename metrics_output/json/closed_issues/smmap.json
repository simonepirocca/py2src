Since [there were already issues with the new signature key being used](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/gitdb/issues/55), I've released gitdb v4.0.1, gitdb2 v3.0.3.post1, gitdb2 v4.0.2, smmap v3.0.1, and smmap2 v3.0.1 without any signature keys.

4096-bit RSA keypair for the file signing.\r\n* Keep your key secret, use a strong unique passphrase for the key.\r\n* Upload the public key to a key server and publish the full fingerprint.\r\n* Sign every new git commit and tag.\r\n* Create signed compressed (xz --best) release archives\r\n* Upload a strong message digest (sha512) of the archive\r\n* Configure https for your download server\r\n\r\n[GPGit](https://github.com/NicoHood/gpgit) is meant to bring GPG to the masses.\r\nIt is not only a shell script that automates the process of creating new signed\r\ngit releases with
