I'm trying to use it in some neural network applications where I'm simplifying the data I am analyzing - mainly vector images.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I get a weird error thrown from the rdp code from the np.linalg.norm calls: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\".  It works on 95% of the time though.  I wonder if you have also encountered this issue before.  If not, I'll try to do more digging to see what is up with this.\r\n\r\nCheers.", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fhirschmann/rdp/issues/5", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fhirschmann/rdp", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fhirschmann/rdp/issues/5/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fhirschmann/rdp/issues/5/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/fhirschmann/rdp/issues/5/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/fhirschmann/rdp/issues/5", "id": 161899276, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNjE4OTkyNzY=", "number": 5, "title": "Recursion bug", "user": {"login": "FlorianWilhelm", "id": 3184072, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxODQwNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3184072?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm", "html_url": "https://github.com/FlorianWilhelm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorianWilhelm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2016-06-23T11:23:27Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-21T21:44:26Z", "closed_at": "2016-11-21T21:44:26Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Although I love recursion and Ramer-Douglas-Peucker is naturally defined as a recursion, this is quite inefficient in Python and leads often to errors like `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison`.
