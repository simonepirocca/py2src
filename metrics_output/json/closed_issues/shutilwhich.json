(see [here.](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/1605)) We like to include hard-links to the license in the package, but that requires both a LICENSE file and a MANIFEST.in file specifying that LICENSE should be included. Would you consider adding one?  Also, can you specify _what version_ of the PSF license you're using for `shutilwhich`? \n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}]}
