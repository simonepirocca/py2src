PyPI?\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphql-relay/0.4.5\r\n\r\nWheels have the following advantages:\r\n* Faster installation time\r\n* Allows the wheel cache to work even when using the new pip hash-checking mode\r\n* Allows tools to statically inspect the package metadata without having to execute untrusted code.\r\n* ...and more - see: http://pythonwheels.com\r\n\r\nThis package is pure Python and supports both Python 2 and 3, so can be distributed as a \"universal wheel\":\r\nhttps://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#wheels\r\n\r\nTo save having to pass `--universal` to `setup.py` each time, the pref can be saved in `setup.cfg`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[bdist_wheel]\r\nuniversal=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Python packaging guide recommends using [Twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine) to upload packages:\r\nhttps://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi\r\n\r\nSo with the `setup.cfg` as above, the steps for building/uploading a new release are then:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install -U twine setuptools wheel\r\n$ rm -rf dist/ build/\r\n$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\r\n$ twine upload dist/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PyPI package listing will then display two entries for the new release, one with type \"Source\" and the other \"Python Wheel\".\r\n\r\nMany thanks :-)",
