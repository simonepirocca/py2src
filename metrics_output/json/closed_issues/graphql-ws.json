10\r\n\r\nqueries using SSL from the GraphQL playground work; subscriptions do not.\r\n\r\nI added an ssl_context to web.run_app; queries worked fine from the Playground client.\r\n\r\nBut when I tried a subscription (and it worked without SSL!):\r\n\r\n**Playground:** `\"error\": \"Could not connect to websocket endpoint ws://myhostnamealias.com:9000/subscriptions.

Is that coming from GraphQL Playground doing a reverse IP lookup? Or was aiohttp or graphql-ws doing a reverse name lookup somewhere because I used the aiohttp default host of \"0.0.0.0\"??\r\n\r\nTo rule that out, I reran the server with certificates for the other host name GraphQL had somewhere got and thought was the \"right\" one to use, and on aiohttp's web.run_app I used a \"host\" argument with the fully qualified host name the playground seemed to think was the \"correct\" one. Same result: queries worked; a subscription query reissued the same \"Could not connect to websocket endpoint...\" error. Removed the SSL from aiohttp and used \"http:\" in my queries+subscriptions -all worked.\r\n\r\nAre there perhaps extra config options for the Playground when using SSL+subscriptions? I couldn't find any relevant ones in a search. Who's injecting that alias name into the Playground's error message? (even though my URL in playground did NOT use it...) Playground? aiohttp? Or graphql-ws??\r\n\r\nSomething else I just noticed: the Playground client error is showing a \"ws:\" scheme, as opposed to a \"wss:\" one. Perhaps that has to be configured in the Playground client? In the graphql-ws aiohttp example, \"protocols\" is set to \"graphql-ws\"; is \"graphql-wss\" also supported? (or _about to_ be supported??)", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-python/graphql-ws/issues/36", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-python/graphql-ws", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-python/graphql-ws/issues/36/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-python/graphql-ws/issues/36/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/graphql-python/graphql-ws/issues/36/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws/issues/36", "id": 503778498, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1MDM3Nzg0OTg=", "number": 36, "title": "Publish graphql-ws to Conda Forge", "user": {"login": "kinow", "id": 304786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow", "html_url": "https://github.com/kinow", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2019-10-08T01:50:28Z", "updated_at": "2020-01-15T22:31:17Z", "closed_at": "2020-01-15T22:31:16Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "* GraphQL WS  version: 0.3.0\r\n* Python version: 3.7\r\n* Operating System: Ubuntu LTS\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi, we are using `graphql-ws` as part of our system.
