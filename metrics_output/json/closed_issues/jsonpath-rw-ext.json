It doesn't seem to work...\n\nExample:\n\n```\nimport jsonpath_rw_ext\n\ndata = [{\"color\": \"blue\", \"flag\": True}, {\"color\": \"green\", \"flag\": False}]\njsp = jsonpath_rw_ext.parse(\"$[?flag = True].color\")\nresults = [match.value for match in jsp.find(data)]\nprint(results)\n```\n\nI expected this to produce `results == [\"blue\"]` but got `[]` instead.\n\nI digged in a little bit and it seems to comes down to the fact that the `True` in the `flag = True` expression ends up as a string `\"True\"` in the `Expression` instance `self.value` in _filters.py (instead of ending up as a boolean `True`). Digging further, points to a limitation in the lexer/parser in jsonpath-rw codebase.\n\nQuestions:\n- Do you have any suggestion for a workaround that does not involve pre-processing the data?\n- Do you think a fix for this could be made at the jsonpath-rw-ext level or would it need to go into jsonpath-rw's codebase?\n- Lastly: you mention that these extensions would be proposed to be integrated into jsonpath-rw.

Making it a list containing a datum which itself has the expected values sort of does the right thing but I'm insufficiently familiar with the parse tree (at least in tonight's exploration) to know what to do.
