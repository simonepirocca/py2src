Indeed, those would be very useful when reading the input line by line and when outputing the result in a stream fashion.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport ndjson\r\n\r\n# Reader\r\nwith open('./posts.jsonl') as f:\r\n  reader = ndjson.reader(f)\r\n\r\n  for post in reader:\r\n    print(post['id'])\r\n\r\n# Writer\r\nwith open('./posts.jsonl', 'w') as f:\r\n  writer = ndjson.writer(f)\r\n\r\n  for item in data:\r\n    writer.writerow(item)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rhgrant10/ndjson/issues/1", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rhgrant10/ndjson", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rhgrant10/ndjson/issues/1/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rhgrant10/ndjson/issues/1/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rhgrant10/ndjson/issues/1/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/rhgrant10/ndjson/issues/1", "id": 415048538, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0MTUwNDg1Mzg=", "number": 1, "title": "Provide LICENCE", "user": {"login": "FlorisHoogenboom", "id": 14967659, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTY3NjU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14967659?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom", "html_url": "https://github.com/FlorisHoogenboom", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/FlorisHoogenboom/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2019-02-27T10:21:29Z", "updated_at": "2019-02-28T06:36:40Z", "closed_at": "2019-02-28T06:36:40Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Could you please provide a licence for this package so I can maybe use it in my work?", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}]}
