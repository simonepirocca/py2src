After a few days of development I was able to get good results in Jaeger using this client library. However I cannot get my change merged in because Jaeger is somehow causing unit tests on the project to fail. PyTest doesn't even start running the suite, it just seems to hang indefintely whilst collecting the tests. I've checked through the debug logs and can't find any obvious cause.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that pytest consistently stops at the same number, which is somewhere near 460/1000 tests. Based on the other issues people have had with this library, my guess is that it's some kind of asyncio threading type problem. Perhaps the system runs into some kind of resource limit?\r\n\r\nI've tried using a fixture to immediately close tracers after creation (like this test cast):\r\nhttps://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/blob/2bb9d0ca9fc2e0517226b632de0f83866d3984c8/tests/test_crossdock.py#L49\r\nIt hasn't worked though.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nI cannot get my change to include tracing with Jaeger passed in my own project due to unit tests failing to collect in pytest.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nI would like to know how other projects are unit tested when using Jaeger. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Any comments, hints or suggestions would be helpful.

Thundra\u2019s way of sending data asynchronously is also promising \r\nSee example https://github.com/serverless/plugins\r\nThe plugins allow for those previously mentioned clients to have auto-wrapped functions for metrics, logging, traces, profilers etc and get deployed using a serverless yml file \r\n\r\nLayers make it even easier so then you don't need the python client in the base lambda function but can just include the layer. The wrapping of function handlers those 3 mentioned packages offer would be sweet for lambda functions using Jaeger and seems intuitive enough and the clients would send data to existing running jaegeragent that could be setup in aws with any preferred method\r\n\r\nI have some additional ideas around this but wanted to see if there was any others who have an interest?\r\n1.we need a serverless plugin for the jaeger client\r\n2. then we could have a lambda layer to make it easier to share the client with other lambda functions\r\n\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/234", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/234/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/234/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/234/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/234", "id": 398496040, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzOTg0OTYwNDA=", "number": 234, "title": "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jaeger_client'", "user": {"login": "AYEG", "id": 5505017, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDUwMTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5505017?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG", "html_url": "https://github.com/AYEG", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AYEG/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2019-01-12T00:07:15Z", "updated_at": "2019-01-21T14:34:08Z", "closed_at": "2019-01-21T14:34:08Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "\r\n## Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?\r\nTrying to use jeager_client for the first time within a flask application and I'm receiving this import error\r\n`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jaeger_client`\r\n\r\nIt was installed with the command:\r\n>  pip install jaeger-client\r\n  within an active conda environment and like other packages I can see it is installed at the correct location. \r\n>  /project-name/bin/python\r\n\r\nThere is an __init__.py in the folder and setting up another module such as Sentry in the same file which works fine. \r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\nI can't import the module.

working on tracing a distributed system that uses message queues between services to process events. Some steps involve batch processing. e.g. - 1,000 events will be taken out of a queue, all processed together, and inserted into downstream queues.\r\n\r\n## Problem - what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement?\r\n\r\nThe problem we're running into is how to model these batch operations. Each event has a trace associated with it, and ideally these batch operations would show up in traces for all events that were in the batch. Conceptually, what I'd like to do is create one span for the batch processing (and perhaps some child spans within it) - and associate it as a child of all the traces of events in the batch.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the opentracing API might support this type of use case via references. However the Python library doesn't currently support them - instead it just picks the first reference and uses it as the parent.\r\n\r\nI am curious if jaeger backend supports using references in this way. If I were to create a span with multiple references, would it show up in all of those traces in the UI? Further - is there any practical difference between using `CHILD_OF` and `FOLLOWS_FROM`?\r\n\r\nI understand that the span would need to pick one of them to use for its trace id, but I am not too concerned about that for now.\r\n\r\n## Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?\r\n\r\nIf this is already supported in the backend - maybe as simple as including the reference information in the thrift messages?\r\n\r\n## Any open questions to address\r\n\r\n<!-- Questions that should be answered before proceeding with implementation. -->\r\n",

I came across this proposal https://github.com/opentracing/specification/issues/77 for adding a `service` tag, but it has not been fleshed out.\r\n\r\nThe go client makes it pretty straightforward to create multiple tracers, by having methods on the `config` object to create a `Sampler` and a `Reporter`. However the python client does all the heavy lifting inside the `initialize_tracer` method, which can only be called once.\r\n\r\nShould we break out factory methods here like we do in the go client?

spans created to track a remove server call.\r\nE.g. While handling an API call from a service ( \"api-service\")  if we are making calls to external services like ElasticSearch or Mongo, new spans which are used to track these remote call can specify \"service_name\"=\"elasticsearch\" or service_name=\"mongo\" instead of using default service_name=\"api-service\".\r\n\r\n\r\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/41", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/41/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/41/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/41/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/issues/41", "id": 224458691, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyMjQ0NTg2OTE=", "number": 41, "title": "SyntaxError in Python 3", "user": {"login": "drzero42", "id": 1853961, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM5NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1853961?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42", "html_url": "https://github.com/drzero42", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drzero42/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 360321606, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwzNjAzMjE2MDY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/labels/help%20wanted", "name": "help wanted", "color": "128A0C", "default": true, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2017-04-26T12:57:34Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-11T20:31:01Z", "closed_at": "2017-08-11T20:31:01Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The function codecs.span_context_to_string has the following line in it:\r\n\r\n`parent_id = parent_id or 0L`\r\n\r\nThis is invalid syntax in Python 3 as per [PEP 237](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0237/), as can be seen here:\r\n`SyntaxError: invalid syntax\r\n Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jaeger_client/__init__.py\", line 32, in <module>\r\n     from .tracer import Tracer  # noqa\r\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jaeger_client/tracer.py\", line 34, in <module>\r\n     from .codecs import TextCodec, ZipkinCodec, ZipkinSpanFormat, BinaryCodec\r\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jaeger_client/codecs.py\", line 140\r\n     parent_id = parent_id or 0L\r\n                               ^\r\n SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\r\n\r\nInstead of 0L in should just be 0.
