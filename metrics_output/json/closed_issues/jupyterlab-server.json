The only thing that really jumps out at me (without adding a bunch of stuff like history/rollback), is the file-system level information, namely modified and created time. This would enable the UI to answer use cases like \"find the settings i most recently changed \" or \"find the workspace I was working on last Tuesday\"\r\n\r\nIt looks like a `workspace` already has a metadata field (`id` lives there), so adding a `last_modified` and `created` would be reasonable, presumably as ISO 8061 dates. \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n{\"values: [{\r\n  \"data\": {...},\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"id\": \"/lab\",\r\n    \"created\": \"2020-07-21T00:19:20+0000\",\r\n    \"last_modified\": \"2020-07-21T00:20:20+0000\"\r\n  }   \r\n}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess these would be overwritten on import/export, with the on-disk time always winning.\r\n\r\nThe settings API response looks a little more complicated, and perhaps these could just be added to the top level of each member of the `settings` array.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n{\r\n  \"settings\": [{\r\n    \"id\": \"@foo/bar\",\r\n    \"raw\": \"...\",\r\n    \"settings\": {...},\r\n    \"schema\": {...},\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"created\": \"2020-07-21T00:19:20+0000\",\r\n    \"last_modified\": \"2020-07-21T00:20:20+0000\"\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n... or `metadata` could be added, with these in it, and eventually extended... though the buck has to stop somewhere, and I don't imagine much but sadness if settings carried anything not validated by the schema, or how it would get populated...
