"``` python\n>>> import pronouncing\n>>> pronouncing.rhymes(\"period\")\n[u'.period', u'myriad']\n>>> pronouncing.rhymes(\"hyphen\")\n[u'-hyphen', u'siphon', u'syphon']\n```\n\nThat `.period` is a bit strange. This is because [cmudict-0.7b](https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy/blob/master/pronouncing/cmudict-0.7b) begins with a load of symbols:\n\n```\n!EXCLAMATION-POINT  EH2 K S K L AH0 M EY1 SH AH0 N P OY2 N T\n\"CLOSE-QUOTE  K L OW1 Z K W OW1 T\n\"DOUBLE-QUOTE  D AH1 B AH0 L K W OW1 T\n\"END-OF-QUOTE  EH1 N D AH0 V K W OW1 T\n\"END-QUOTE  EH1 N D K W OW1 T\n\"IN-QUOTES  IH1 N K W OW1 T S\n...\n```\n\nSo this isn't necessarily a bug in Pronouncing, but more a case of how to interpret the input data. (In a way it's `.` that rhymes with `period` and not `.period`; `-` rhymes with `hyphen` and not `-hyphen`.) Would it make sense to filter some of these out? \n\nThis isn't a problem for me, I just noticed it in some unusual output and thought I'd mention it.\n\nIf they were filtered, care should be taken not to filter things like:\n\n```\n'ALLO  AA2 L OW1\n'BOUT  B AW1 T\n'CAUSE  K AH0 Z\n'COURSE  K AO1 R S\n'CUSE  K Y UW1 Z\n```\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/11", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/11/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/11/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/11/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/11", "id": 113780052, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxMTM3ODAwNTI=", "number": 11, "title": "Time for a new release?", "user": {"login": "hugovk", "id": 1324225, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyMjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1324225?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk", "html_url": "https://github.com/hugovk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2015-10-28T09:48:28Z", "updated_at": "2017-01-17T16:34:51Z", "closed_at": "2017-01-17T16:34:51Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "There's been a number of changes since the last release in June:\n\nhttps://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy/compare/0.1.2...master\n", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/8", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/8/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/8/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/8/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy/issues/8", "id": 92713239, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU5MjcxMzIzOQ==", "number": 8, "title": "LRU cache for phones_for_word lookups", "user": {"login": "aparrish", "id": 125839, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgzOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/125839?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish", "html_url": "https://github.com/aparrish", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aparrish/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2015-07-02T19:16:10Z", "updated_at": "2017-01-17T16:13:46Z", "closed_at": "2017-01-17T16:13:45Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I'm actually using the library for a thing right now and the performance isn't quite where I want it to be.
