It's been a lifesaver in productivity for me and certainly many others as well.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon a problem in my own code where user had used UAE for United Arab Emirates instead of ARE and it was accepted since another system knew of this code. UAE is a curious case as every other country code system (as well as their official usage) refers to them as that instead of ARE, so the mistake is understandable. Upon further inspection I noticed that there are a few other similar cases (URY, VAT and VNM to name a few) where the codes differ.\r\n\r\nIt isn't in the core scope of this project, but for usability it might be good to support either a common other country code or a country code from specified other system (UNDP for example).
