I've always just typed the all lowercase version into a `requirements.txt` or `pip install` command.  Turns out that either is fine, per [PEP 426](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0426/#name)\r\n\r\n> All comparisons of distribution names MUST be case insensitive, and MUST consider hyphens and underscores to be equivalent.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm currently working towards is making an `is_environment_up_to_date` function, in which I need to look over the keys in the dict I got back from `pip_api.parse_requirements`, and see if they're all present in the dict I got back from `pip_api.installed_distributions`.  The fact that putting \"django\" as a line in \"requirements.txt\" and having `pip_api` tell me that that item wasn't installed threw me for a loop for a minute.\r\n\r\nCertainly I could solve my problem by just capitalizing the first letter of that line.  However, I'd love to see this project get \"better\" (according to me) by more closely following relevant PEPs.  I propose that both of the aforementioned functions `pip_api.parse_requirements` and `pip_api.installed_distributions` no longer return a plain dict object, but a dict-subclass that is case insensitive, like [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51083318).  Then if I have `django` in my `requirements.txt`, and `Django` is installed (thanks whoever made that weird, arbitrary, and unpythonic decision for Django!), then this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreqs = pip_api.parse_requirements('requirements.txt')\r\ndeps = pip_api.installed_distributions()\r\nassert all(req in deps for req in reqs.keys())\r\n```\r\nwill succeed.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with my proposal, I'll happily submit a PR.  :)", "performed_via_github_app": null, "score": 1.0}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/di/pip-api/issues/35", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/di/pip-api", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/di/pip-api/issues/35/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/di/pip-api/issues/35/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/di/pip-api/issues/35/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/di/pip-api/issues/35", "id": 462158035, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0NjIxNTgwMzU=", "number": 35, "title": "Handle relative paths in `-r` links", "user": {"login": "malikoth", "id": 2665937, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjU5Mzc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2665937?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth", "html_url": "https://github.com/malikoth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/malikoth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2019-06-28T18:30:47Z", "updated_at": "2019-07-01T19:24:54Z", "closed_at": "2019-07-01T18:21:32Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "This project is awesome, thank you so much!\r\n\r\nOK, for context, here's the structure of requirements that I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequirements.txt\r\nreqs/base.txt\r\nreqs/dev.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n`requirements.txt` contains the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-r reqs/dev.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n`reqs/dev.txt` contains the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-r base.txt\r\nwerkzeug\r\n```\r\n\r\n`reqs/base.txt` contains the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndjango\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a completely valid structure, as I can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and I get both django and werkzeug installed.  If I modify the first line of `reqs/dev.txt` to read `-r reqs/base.txt`, then I get the following error upon running `pip install -r requirements.txt`: `ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'reqs/reqs/base.txt'`  So pip requires that references to other requirements files be expressed as a path relative to the file being parsed.\r\n\r\nOK, so here's the problem.  I call `pip_api.parse_requirements('requirements.txt')`, and I get the following (excerpt of a) traceback:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    reqs = pip_api.parse_requirements('requirements.txt')\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip_api/_parse_requirements.py\", line 183, in parse_requirements\r\n    lines = \"\".join(_read_file(filename)).replace(\"\\\\\\n\", \"\").splitlines()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip_api/_parse_requirements.py\", line 47, in _read_file\r\n    with open(filename) as f:\r\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'base.txt'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's reading `requirements.txt`, finding the line pointing to `reqs/dev.txt`, parsing it, finding a reference to `base.txt`, and then failing because it can't find that file in the repository root next to `requirements.txt`.  \r\n\r\n`pip_api` needs to handle file paths as being relative to the file being parsed as pip does, because setting them to be parseable by `pip_api` right now makes it so that my `pip install` command no longer works.
